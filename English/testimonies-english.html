              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
              <p>I am from a village called LB Charla in Narasapuram Mandal, West Godavari District. I was born as the only son to Vatala Ramaswamy and Mangamma. During my childhood, we faced severe financial difficulties. In the midst of that hardship, my mother accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as her personal Savior. From that moment onward, our financial situation began to improve. I was able to continue my studies up to the degree level.</p>
              <p>After my marriage, I began to handle our family’s financial matters. Unfortunately, I faced repeated losses and eventually fell into debt. During a particularly difficult time, I went to church for my son's naming ceremony. As soon as I entered the church, tears began to flow from my eyes—that was the moment I truly encountered God.</p>
              <p>From 1996 to 2005, I regularly attended church in my village. However, due to our worsening financial condition, we had to sell all our property to repay our debts. I tried many different jobs, but nothing worked out. Still, I continued going to church every Sunday, praying and fasting, but I couldn't find a stable way to support my family.</p>
              <p>During that time, while reading the Bible, Psalm 32:8 spoke to me: “I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go.” I prayed based on that verse. It was then that God spoke to me and said, “I am giving you a job in My defense department.” When I asked the Lord where I should receive training and who was doing true ministry, He showed me Holy Army Fellowship (HAF).</p>
              <p>In June 2005, I came to Mandavalli and entered into a time of repentance. God revealed many sins in my life. I confessed every sin, and I stayed in the church for four days, spending time in prayer.</p>
              <p>During that time, God spoke to me about many things and revealed His will to me. In the same year, during the month of July, I joined the ministry training.</p>
              <p>Now, by God's grace, I am serving the Lord. He has given me the privilege and honor to live for Him.</p>
              <p>May all the glory be to God.</p>
              <p>Greetings to all.</p>
              <p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>

              <p>Beloved in lord,</p>
              <p>I am from Gudivada, Krishna District. My family was unaware of the  Jesus Christ, when I was born. During my childhood, I used to follow the traditions passed down from my grandfather and father, yet I was unable to live a good or righteous life. Without going to school, I used to be involved in stealing and telling lies. By the time I reached my youth, my desires had become worldly. My eyes were filled with impurity and deeply influenced by movies, Watching inappropriate scenes, drinking, gambling, and cockfighting had all become my habits.</p>
              <p>Outwardly, I pretended to be a good person, and everyone believed I was. On several occasions, I genuinely desired to lead a better and more upright life, but I found myself unable to overcome my shortcomings. Eventually, my parents got me married, and things went well for a few years. However, conflicts arose within the family, and I lost peace of mind. At one point, my father asked me to leave the house and live separately. I was afraid—worried about how I would survive.</p>
              <p>During this time, some people told me, "If you come to know the Lord, you will find answers in your family." But I refused to listen. As the problems in my family continued to grow, I went to my relatives seeking help. Even though they came, no solution was found in our household. Night after night, we would all be in tears. At that point, I felt in my heart that if I believed in the Lord, good things would happen—and so I placed my trust in Him. But I didn’t know how to worship. I thought I could learn by watching those who went to church. As I kept watching many of them, I began to think that just believing in the Lord was enough—even if there were flaws in their lives. With that mindset, I continued living in sin, assuming that Jesus would forgive my sins every day.Though I tried to be good, I failed repeatedly.</p>
              <p>One day, two servants from Holy Army Fellowship visited our home and shared their testimonies of salvation. They said, “If you  repent yourself infront of god, *God will bring answers into your family*. God will change your life. God will speak to you.” They encouraged me to read the book Testimony of M. Abraham garu . I didn’t believe them at first. But they shared boldly, saying, “God spoke to us and changed our lives. If you come, God will speak to you and change your life.” Their words surprised and challenged me. I hoped to receive repent by reading the book Testimony of M. Abraham garu . My wife and I came to Mandavalli for repentance. Spiritual Mother guided us into repentance by teaching us how to pray. As I prayed, God revealed my life like a movie before my eyes. I was broken. I repented for my sinful life and confessed everything with tears. I cried out to the Lord to change me, and He gave me a new heart and transformed my mind.</p>
              <p>I made peace with those I had wronged, returned what I had stolen or taken dishonestly, and sought forgiveness. I felt peace, joy, and boldness in my heart. God called me to serve Him, but at first, I was reluctant. Yet, He spoke to me through His Word, encouraged me, and led me into his ministry. After completing my training in Mandavalli, I engaged in ministry across various regions, following the guidance of Spiritual Mother.</p>
              <p>I am now serving in the place where God has called me. Please pray for me—to remain faithful to God until the end, both in ministry and for the well-being of my family.</p>
              <p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>I greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I was born into a family that did not know God. Since my parents didn’t know Jesus Christ, I followed in the way they led me. My mother was suffering from an illness, and despite visiting many doctors, she did not recover. She even went to spirit healers, but nothing helped. Her condition worsened day by day, and eventually, we brought her back from the hospital with no hope.</p>
<p>At that time, a woman who knew Jesus Christ came and spoke to us about the Lord. She said that Jesus is a great God who performs miracles. She told my mother that Jesus could heal her and prayed for her. Through that prayer, my mother placed her faith in Jesus—and He healed her. She is alive to this day.</p>
<p>After that, my parents began attending prayer meetings, and we children went along with them. However, I was not living a righteous life. Though I went to church and sang songs, I did not live a faithful life. I watched movies, drank alcohol, ate unhealthy food, told lies, and used foul language. I was living in sin, and as I grew older, I continued in these sinful habits.</p>
<p>I traveled to different places, and my life became worse. I began to feel hopeless and shared my struggles with my friends. Around that time, some brothers and sisters who had been saved came to our village. They shared how their lives had changed and how they had repaid those they had wronged. I was amazed to see such transformation and thought, “Could this kind of change happen in my life?”</p>
<p>But I was afraid. I thought my bad habits and addictions were too strong and that I would never be able to change. The brothers and sisters said to me, “You have known the Lord since childhood. God changed our lives, and He can change yours too.” But I paid no attention to their words.</p>
<p>My parents, who had experienced salvation, also encouraged me, but by then, I had stopped going to prayer meetings for many years. In 2004, a servant of God, Brother Abraham, came to our village and organized meetings. The brothers were working hard in the ministry, and I reluctantly went to one of the evening meetings.</p>
<p>In that meeting, Brother Abraham preached about how sin brings a curse into a family. He said, “Your sin can become a curse to your family. One person’s disobedience can lead many to disobedience, and one person’s obedience can lead many to obedience.” These words pierced my heart. I wept and prayed, realizing, “Yes, I should not remain disobedient. I need to change my life.”</p>
<p>That evening, I experienced victory over my addictions. I began attending church regularly and continued in fellowship. One Saturday evening, I went again to the Mandavalli prayer meeting. As I stepped into the place, I felt a deep peace in my heart. That night, Brother Abraham spoke about how many rejoiced at the birth of John the Baptist. He asked, “How was your birth? Were you born to bring joy to others?”</p>
<p>He shared an example from the forest, where wild pigs would destroy crops. To stop them, farmers would place a sharp knife coated with a substance that attracted the pigs. As the pigs licked it, they would unknowingly drink their own blood and eventually die. Brother Abraham explained that Satan deceives young people in the same way—leading them to their destruction while making them believe they are enjoying life.</p>
<p>This example struck me. I realized that I was like one of those wild pigs—living in sin, unaware that I was destroying myself. I wept and prayed, saying, “Lord, I want to change. I want my life to bring joy to others.”</p>
<p>The servants of God who came to our village encouraged me to receive salvation. I decided to surrender my life to the Lord. For about 15 days, I spent time in prayer at Mandavalli, seeking God’s presence. During that time, God revealed many areas in my life where I had gone wrong—especially how I had treated my mother, my sister, and others. I realized I had sinned against them, and God was convicting me of my wrongdoings.</p>
<p>Through deep prayer and repentance, I received forgiveness from God. I reconciled with the Lord and with those I had hurt. The testimonies of the servants of God strengthened me, and by God’s grace, I received true repentance. I began to live a life that pleased God.</p>
<p>Through Brother Abraham’s ministry, I came to understand the love of God. I also learned the importance of marriage, food, and clothing—all of which God provided without dowry or expense. In 2008, I began serving the Lord and learned many lessons through His guidance.</p>
<p>In 2012, I was called into full-time ministry. During that time, the Lord strengthened me greatly. However, during the pandemic, I became seriously ill. The church and my fellowship group prayed earnestly for me, and God provided the financial support needed for my treatment. Many people thought I would not survive, but God preserved my life.</p>
<p>Now, I am living by faith and trusting in the Lord daily. My family and I continue to walk with Him.</p>
<p>I humbly request your prayers—that I may continue to serve the Lord faithfully and live in a way that brings glory to His name. I thank God for His mercy and for the love and support of my dear brothers and sisters in Christ.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>I come from a small village called Jangareddygudem in the West Godavari district. I was born into a family that did not know the Lord Jesus. My parents had three children—two older sisters and myself, the youngest. Tragedy struck early in our lives when both my mother and father passed away when I was just five years old. We were then lovingly raised by my maternal grandaunt, my mother’s sister, who had no children of her own. She took us in and cared for us as if we were her own.</p>
<p>When I was in seventh grade, my eldest sister became seriously ill. Her kidneys and liver were severely damaged. Despite visiting many hospitals, doctors gave up hope, saying she would not survive. During that time, a Christian sister told us, “If you believe in the Lord Jesus, she will be healed.” Desperate for hope, and despite opposition from our relatives, we visited a church for the very first time. My sister was baptized soon after. However, she passed away shortly afterward. From that point on, we stopped going to the church.</p>
<p>Due to financial difficulties, I had to stop my education and started working as a Masonry. As I grew older, my thoughts and desires had already become deeply corrupted.I became addicted to alcohol and immoral living. Outwardly, I appeared cheerful and made others laugh, but inwardly, I had no peace , lacked joy. I couldn’t sleep at night. Whenever I was alone, I was haunted by tormenting thoughts —“Why am I alive? What is the purpose of my life?” I was desperately searching for peace.</p>
<p>It was then that evangelist, sent by the Lord, visited our area from Mandavalli.One of our relatives had a repentance and came to faith, and Inspired by her testimony, both my elder sister and my mother's sister also repented and came to faith. They invited Evangelist to our home, and they preached the gospel to me many times, But I had no interest in listening, as I did not like being associated with anyone who knew the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Most of my friends were Christians. While they attended church on Sundays, they also accompanied me to bars and immoral places. This hypocrisy deeply disappointed me and led me to despise Christians—and even Christ Himself. Yet, I was still searching for peace. During my travels for work, I observed many people and came to the conclusion that having plenty of money would bring me peace. From that moment on, I became consumed with the desire to earn wealth.</p>
<p>I began placing cricket bets. Starting with just ₹1,000, I quickly earned ₹50,000 in a week. I dreamt of making ₹10 lakhs, investing it, and living comfortably without ever working again. But as quickly as the money came, it vanished.
 
In the hope of winning again, I borrowed money from many people and continued gambling—but I lost everything. Around that time, my elder sister and mother's sister began attending retreats in Mandavalli. Meanwhile, I also lost ₹2 lakhs that I had saved at home to build a house. Eventually, I even pawned the gold we had in the house and lost that too.</p>
<p>In utter despair, I decided to end my life. I swallowed twenty sleeping pills and slashed the veins in both my wrists six times with a blade.Yet, I did not die. I tried to hang myself from the ceiling fan, but the fan broke and I fell to the ground—still, I survived .</p>
<p>Determined to end my life, I went to Rajahmundry with the intention of jumping into the Godavari River from the bridge. Just as I was about to jump, my mother's sister called. I thought I would say a final word before ending it all, so I answered the call and shared everything with her. She pleaded with me not to go through with it. Because of her heartfelt cries, I returned home.</p>
<p>God’s servants visited again and reminded me, “It is not God’s will that any sinner should perish in his sin.” They urged me to repent and left me with a testimony book by Bro. Abraham . At first, I ignored it.</p>
<p>Despite several attempts to live righteously, my addictions only grew worse. One day, having read Bro.Abraham testimony book, I came to Mandavalli with a desire to repent. Yet, I was still doubtful, wondering whether God would truly speak to me.</p>
<p>One night while I was praying, the Lord brought something to my remembrance: A long time ago, I used to go to work with my elder brother and brother-in-law. My brother had fallen in love with a woman and eventually married her. He lived with them along with her mother, who was paralyzed and bedridden. One day, while we were drinking, he expressed his frustration, saying that her presence was becoming a burden. At that moment, I took it upon myself to put her on a train bound for Odisha. We placed her on the train at Tadepalligudem and got off ourselves at Rajahmundry.</p>
<p>I had completely forgotten that incident, but that night the Lord brought it back to my memory. He made me realize, 'This is the kind of person you are.' Overwhelmed with conviction, I broke down in tears and confessed every sin in prayer.During that moment of repentance, I heard a voice say, “Isaiah 43:5.” When I opened my eyes, everyone was asleep. I rushed to Evangelist and told them what happened. They showed me the verse in the Bible. I had never read the Bible or attended church before—this was no illusion.</p>
<p>It was the Lord Himself speaking to me. That day, I experienced the true peace and joy that only God can give. By the grace of God, I later got married and am now serving the Lord in ministry, following His divine calling.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, I humbly ask for your prayers as I continue in His service.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>

              <p>Beloved in lord,</p>
<p>My name is Yohan, and I am from Laxmipuram, Pallepalem village. My parents had four children, and I was the youngest. I was born into a family that did not know Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>During my childhood, my mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a heart condition. The doctors declared that she would not survive, so she was brought home and left outside. At that time, some of our relatives shared the gospel with us, saying that Jesus Christ could heal my mother. However, my father refused to believe. Despite his opposition, our relatives would come and pray when he was not around.</p>
<p>One night, the Lord Jesus miraculously touched my mother, enabling her to sit up. Witnessing this miracle, she placed her faith in Christ, started attending a nearby church, and later received baptism. Every year, she would organize thanksgiving prayers, but I never participated. I would leave home and return only after midnight. My mother would often plead with me, saying, "I am spending so much for these prayers—why don't you change your life?" I would challenge her, asking, "Show me one truly righteous person among those who come to pray."</p>
<p>Years passed, She told me for 11 years in the same way , she heard a testimony and gospel through a cassette of Brother Abraham. That message led my mother to true repentance, and she told me, that her past religious practices had been in vain. She then urged me, "Just once, go to Mandavalli and see for yourself. If you find true devotion, follow it; if not, you can walk away." Though I agreed, I never actually went.</p>
<p>Later, I suffered a significant financial loss in business, amounting to several lakhs. It was then that I realized that God was trying to draw me to Him. For the first time, on February 1, 2003, I attended an All-Night Prayer at Mandavalli. As Evangelist preached the gospel, they said, "Brother, Jesus Christ came into this world for you. He was wounded for your sins, nails were driven into His hands and feet for your transgressions, and He died for your sake. But He is coming again, and when He does, He will hold you accountable for your life from childhood. If you fall short, the fire will not be quenched, and the worm will not die."</p>
<p>These words pierced my heart. I began to ask myself, What is sin? Why did He have to suffer and die for me? Fear gripped me as my past sins came to my mind. I repented wholeheartedly, confessing every sin before God.</p>
<p>God revealed to me every sin I had committed since my childhood. I was filled with deep remorse and confessed all my sins before Him. At that moment, Jesus Christ appeared before me in a vision. I was overwhelmed with joy as God poured His grace upon me.</p>
<p>Filled with that newfound happiness, I returned home, sought forgiveness from everyone, and restored everything I had wrongfully taken. After learning essential biblical teachings from Evangelist, I obeyed the Lord’s calling and went to Mandavalli Headquarters for training. There, I received spiritual guidance under God's ordained spiritual Mother, and was later sent to a specific region for ministry according to God's will.</p>
<p>Now, I continue to serve the Lord in His calling. Please pray that I remain steadfast in my faith and ministry until the end and that my family remains faithful to God.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>
<p>Brother Yohan</p>

            <div class="testimony-full">
              I live in a small village called Lakshmipuram in Krishna District. My wife and I used to attend the church regularly. After some time, God blessed us with two sons. Though we continued attending church, there was no real change in my life. I still carried my old habits. After some time, our pastor baptized both my wife and me, but even then, my life remained unchanged.</p>
<p>My wife and I used to travel ten kilometers from our village to attend church, and we often quarrel with each other during the bus journey. I had no peace of mind. We used to attend gatherings in nearby villages and towns. As I listened to the preaching of the Word, I began to feel a deep sense of conviction and even disgust toward myself.</p>
<p>I was in a constant state of struggle, and there seemed to be no change in my life. One day, I decided to fast and pray for 40 days, believing it might bring some change. There was a church in our village where they were observing fasting days, so I joined them. I spent 40 days without food, but I didn’t know how to pray or how to confess my sins. I would simply pray, "Lord, bless me, bless me, bless me."</p>
<p>After completing the 40 days, I came out of the church, but instead of finding peace, I felt even more broken. I still had no peace, joy, or rest. I couldn’t sleep at night. My thoughts were filled with worry about my life and my family. God began to make me understand my family’s situation. My father was a heavy drinker who never took care of our household. From my childhood, I had been in emotional turmoil, crying every day.</p>
<p>God showed me that my children would experience the same suffering if I didn’t change. That night, I cried out to God with tears, praying that my children would not have to go through the same painful experiences I had. I realized then that even if I earn nothing else in this world, it would be enough if I could pass on godliness and righteousness to my children.</p>
<p>I wanted to walk in the right path and live a life of true devotion. I searched for the right way and consulted many pastors. I continued attending church regularly. Together with some youth in our village, we decided to organize revival meetings. We invited pastors from faraway places and held three-day meetings. We did this for three years. Yet, I still could not find the spiritual path I was longing for.</p>
<p>By that time, some people from our village had attended the ‘Holy Army Fellowship’ and experienced repentance. They came to me and shared, ‘We have been going to church for 15 years and thought we were leading a devotional life. But when we went to Mandavalli and heard from Brother Abraham, we realized we needed true repentance. While staying there, God revealed our sins like a film played before our eyes. We confessed everything, and God spoke to us. We felt a joy we had never known.’</p>
<p>They encouraged me to come and experience that same transformation. I asked many questions, and they answered with great love and patience. Even when I spoke harshly, their words left a deep impression on me. They would occasionally visit me and speak with me, and they gave me a spiritual magazine published through the Evangelist, Brother Abraham.</p>
<p>As I was reading that magazine, a verse from Psalm 45:7 strengthened me. I didn’t take their words seriously at first, but the verse in the magazine deeply touched me. Based on that, my wife and I also went to Mandavalli and repented. I confessed my sins, and God spoke to me. After joining the Holy Army Fellowship, I received joy and peace.</p>
<p>Through the church in that village, Evangelist Brother Solomon came. From then on, we began attending church regularly. He used to take us to Mandavalli, and Brother Abraham would spend time speaking with us, teaching us faith and devotion.</p>
<p>As we continued to grow in God and walked in the right path, one day my younger son, who was three years old at the time, suffered a severe seizure and became stiff. When the doctors tried to give him an injection, it wouldn’t go in. Eventually, they told us there was nothing more they could do and left.</p>
<p>Dear ones, at that moment, I didn’t know what to do. Based on the thought that God gave me, I tearfully called Brother Abraham and explained what had happened. He encouraged me, prayed, and said, “Go home; your son will get up and sit.” I rushed home, and I saw my son sitting up. That brought me great happiness. Many such miracles have happened in my life.</p>
<p>During this time, my wife also started becoming weak. We went to the hospital where, after a scan revealed lumps in her breast, they diagnosed her with breast cancer. They suggested surgery to remove the lumps but said they couldn't guarantee the outcome. I was shattered and filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>In that time of prayer and despair, we went to Brother Abraham in Mandavalli and explained everything about my wife's condition. He was deeply moved and said, “At such a young age, such a disease,” and he comforted us with the promises of God from Matthew 10:1–9. He gave us hope, saying that if we pray with faith, God would remove the disease. As we continued praying, her health began to improve.</p>
<p>God continued to perform miracles, and day by day, we received new joy. Later, Brother Abraham, having fulfilled the Lord's call, went to be with the Lord. I cried for many days. I couldn’t find comfort from that grief. Whether my eyes were open or closed, I could see Brother Abraham in front of me.</p>
<p>After many days, I understood that Brother Abraham would not return. I became angry with God and felt like giving up on God. At that time, Sister Rani Abraham sent some believers and Evangelists to our area from the fellowship. They said, “Brother Abraham faithfully received promises, established the fellowship, ministered powerfully in a short time, and entered the Kingdom of Heaven according to God’s will.”</p>
<p>With the desire to live faithfully for God, I began spending more time with the pastor serving in our area. During this time, God began to speak to me and called me into ministry. I thought I was already serving alongside the pastors, but God spoke to me three times. The third time, He told me clearly to go for training in Mandavalli.</p>
<p>That word scared me because I had no education, I grew up in a village, and I didn’t know how to speak with people. Still, I had the desire to serve. But because I had many debts, I thought I should first clear them and then go for ministry. Due to famine in our area, I decided to buy an auto to earn and pay off the debts.</p>
<p>That night, God told me, “Do not buy an auto. You will suffer loss, and many others will suffer with you.” But I did not listen to God. I followed my own understanding and took more loans to buy the auto. I gave the vehicle to one person, and he had an accident. Then I gave it to another person, and he too had an accident. My debts increased even more.</p>
<p>I had to put aside my Bible and drive the auto myself. As time went on and the debts were nearly repaid, a weak thought entered my heart—to stay with the pastor and continue driving the auto to make a living. Immediately, I met with an accident. Everyone on the road was injured and lying in pain.</p>
<p>I raised my hands to heaven and cried, “Lord, it’s because of me—please forgive me.” By God’s grace, no one lost their life. But then, another accident happened. At that moment, I could no longer bear the shame. I thought of ending my life.</p>
<p>The fellowship, the Evangelist, and the church people supported me with great love. The Lord Himself spoke to me saying, “Do not be afraid, be courageous.” Those words filled me with strength and boldness. I sold the auto, cleared all my debts, and went to training in Mandavalli. Spiritual mother and the sisters there encouraged me and helped me stand firm.</p>
<p>By the grace of God, I am now continuing in the Lord’s ministry. I humbly request you all to pray earnestly for me—to remain faithful to the fellowship and to the Lord.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Tadishetty Yesubabu. I was born as the second child to my parents. My mother suffered from tuberculosis, and her health deteriorated severely. Though my father tried every possible way to cure her, nothing helped. Out of desperation, they went to Ingilipakalanka, hoping to find a solution.</p>
<p>There, someone told them, “The Lord Jesus can heal her.” Believing this, both of them began attending church, listened to the Word of God, and were spiritually strengthened. Eventually, both of them repented. Shortly after, my father saw a vision of the Lord, who said that He was going to take my mother to heaven. Soon after, my mother passed away in the Lord.</p>
<p>After her death, my father backslid. He returned to alcohol and eventually remarried. He left me at my uncle’s house and went back to our village.</p>
<p>From a young age, I grew up and studied under Brother Abraham. He taught me many spiritual truths. He was a man of strong prayer — when he prayed for rain, it rained; when he prayed for it to stop, it stopped. Many people with various diseases came to the Lord through him and were healed.</p>
<p>I was a poor student in school and was often considered slow. But when I was in 7th grade, our spiritual mother prayed for my studies, and from that time, God gave me wisdom and memory. That year, I passed with good marks.</p>
<p>Though I was raised in a spiritual environment, as I grew older, worldly desires began to take over. I started watching TV serials, attending church in the morning, and going to movies in the evening. My thoughts became corrupt, and my heart was filled with pride and hardness.</p>
<p>I had no peace or joy in my life. I was filled with anger, hatred, and grudges. I became a slave to many addictions.</p>
<p>When Brother Abraham prayed about my future, the Lord told him that I would become a collector. Brother Abraham said to me, “If you keep your heart right and stay holy, it will come to pass.”</p>
<p>I tried to change my life — I changed rooms, changed friends — but nothing changed within me. I didn’t understand that without true repentance and confession of sin, no transformation could happen.</p>
<p>While trying for a job, I failed everywhere. I became discouraged and hopeless. I experienced severe poverty.</p>
<p>But God is not unjust. The same God who called my mother took great care of me too. Even though I didn’t please Him or praise Him, He never stopped showing me mercy.</p>
<p>God gave me a wife from a God-fearing family, and through her, I received a few acres of land. I started fish and prawn farming, and with that, my wealth increased. God also blessed us with two children, and life seemed to go on smoothly.</p>
<p>However, I had no interest in heaven and no fear of sin. One day, Brother Abraham spoke to me and said, “No matter how many crores you earn, it won’t take you to heaven. The Lord’s coming is near. Repent and serve the Lord.”</p>
<p>Just a few days after saying this, Brother Abraham went to be with the Lord. That deeply shook me. The Holy Spirit began to work powerfully in me. I went to the Mandavalli Prayer Hall and stayed there for 13 days, weeping and repenting for my sins.</p>
<p>During that time, God spoke to me personally, and I came to understand that He had forgiven my sins. Through Isaiah 45:3, the Lord spoke to me again and gave me great peace.</p>
<p>Then I began to pray about entering full-time ministry. After two years of prayer, God clearly showed me a specific place to serve.</p>
<p>Now, by God’s grace, I have left behind my business and property, and along with my family, I am serving the Lord in the place He has appointed.</p>
<p>Please remember me and my family in your prayers. Heartfelt thanks and blessings to you all.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>I was born in a village near Amalapuram. In that village, we did not know about the Lord Jesus or about the love of Christ. I was walking in the path shown by my parents. My childhood passed, and during my youth, due to the influence of my friends, I lived in drinking, gambling, and sin. Because of this bad life of mine, my parents arranged my marriage.</p>
<p>After marriage, I went to my mother-in-law's house. That night, my mother-in-law was crying. I asked my wife, “Why is she crying?” My wife replied, “She is not crying. She is praying, trusting in the Lord Jesus.”</p>
<p>Some time later, two children were born to us. I became weak due to a combination of typhoid and malaria. I was bedridden, very weak, and in a state where I could not walk. During that time, the Holy Army Fellowship brought the gospel to us. The Evangelist invited me to a church where they prayed. I didn’t like the idea of God.</p>
<p>One day, my friends took me to a brothel. While they were inside that house singing songs about Jesus, I saw one woman coming and committing sin with my friend. From that time, my heart became hardened, and I started disliking the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>My younger sister believed in the Lord Jesus and joined the Holy Army Fellowship. One day, my wife and I went to her house. When my wife said she wanted to join the fellowship meeting there, I didn’t like it and ended up hitting her in front of the pastor.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the Evangelist came and shared the gospel with me three times. They lovingly held my beard and spoke to me. Then, on the fourth occasion, my little child developed a cough and difficulty breathing. We took her to the local hospital, and after checking, the doctors said the child’s condition was serious and advised us to take her to a bigger hospital.</p>
<p>After staying in the hospital for a few days and bringing her home, she again had cough, breathlessness, and vomiting. When we took her to the hospital, even the doctor could not understand what the illness was. They suggested doing a scan, but since we didn’t have enough money, we took her to Rajahmundry hospital. Around 7:30, the pastor came, prayed, and said we should leave.</p>
<p>At that time, we had to cross via sand boats. The child's cough and breathlessness worsened, and my father came running near the boats saying that she had died. When I went home, my wife told me what happened — “The child had severe cough and breathlessness and died. I prayed, and now she is slightly breathing, and her fist moved.”</p>
<p>That night, my wife and I prayed to God. God healed her and removed that disease. From then on, we started going to the Church. The Evangelist told us to repent. But I didn’t know what repentance meant. Then they explained, “When you repent and confess your sins, God will speak to you.” That surprised me.</p>
<p>In May 2010, during a retreat, I truly repented. When God revealed my sins to me, I was convicted and confessed all my sins, corrected myself, and truly repented. I went to my native village and made right all my wrongdoings. I have continued in this way since then.</p>
<p>When God called me for His service, I was afraid and hesitated for some time. At that time, I was operating a Tata AC vehicle, and by accident, it fell into a canal. Many people there assumed I was dead. But I came out without any injuries. Based on that incident, I understood what the Evangelist were saying.</p>
<p>After that, I came to Mandavalli for training. After one year of training, responding to God’s call, I Continue to serve the Lord in his Ministry.</p>
<p>I am concluding this short testimony requesting that you pray for me and my service.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Ezra. I come from Challapalli village in Krishna district. I was born as the first child to my parents. My father was involved in ministry, and I grew up as the son of an evangelist. From my childhood, I was raised in devotion, but as I grew older, sin slowly began to enter my life.</p>
<p>Although I was involved in ministry from a young age, I gradually began to fall into sins such as lying, small thefts, foul language, and mischief. Eventually, I developed a habit of watching movies. As I grew older, the presence of sin in my life also increased.</p>
<p>During my intermediate years, I made bad friends in college and started engaging in worthless conversations and watching inappropriate movies. Though my life was falling apart, my parents believed I was a good boy. I used to pretend in front of them. I would frequently listen to movie songs and claim I was listening to Christian songs. They believed I was a good son.</p>
<p>One day, a classmate of mine came to my mother and told her, “Your son is living a bad life.” When my mother asked me about it, I denied everything and said, “That’s all lies—don’t believe him, believe me,” and escaped the situation. Thus, I continued to live a sinful life through my youth.</p>
<p>When I joined degree college, I became known for creating trouble. I earned a bad reputation in college. I had a short temper and even challenged college staff, making some of them cry. There were even staff meetings held because of me.</p>
<p>Though I was living sinfully, one of my lecturers, who was a Christian, used to warn me, but I wouldn't listen. I continued going to church on Sundays and attending meetings, but I did not give up sin. I couldn’t control my evil thoughts either.</p>
<p>As my life continued to deteriorate, my father stopped doing ministry and returned to our native village. He started attending a few churches. One day, evangelists from Holy Army Fellowship came to Challapalli and conducted meetings.</p>
<p>There, my father saw Evangelist Abraham and remembered that he had attended his wedding. He introduced himself, and through this, our family was connected to Holy Army Fellowship Church.</p>
<p>The evangelists shared the gospel and asked us to repent, but I kept making excuses and avoided it. Then in May 2017, a retreat was held at Mandavalli. Since I had holidays, I decided to attend to repent.</p>
<p>On my way to Mandavalli, I thought, “I should stop living in sin.” After staying there for a few days, I confessed all my sins in prayer. God showed me every sin I had committed since childhood. I repented deeply and asked God for forgiveness. God spoke to me through Matthew chapter 9, assuring me that my sins were forgiven.</p>
<p>I experienced great joy. I was delivered from all my sins. God gave me victory in my thoughts as well. I was truly happy. Before this, even though I went to church and was the son of an evangelist, I had no victory over sin and no real peace or joy. But now God gave me true joy.</p>
<p>Later, one day my father said, “Don’t go to Holy Army Fellowship Church, I will conduct prayer for you at home.” But we refused. After knowing the truth and understanding true devotion, I desired to live righteously. But my father asked us to leave the house if we continued going to that church. Though we were willing to leave the house, we were not willing to leave the righteous path we had found.</p>
<p>As I continued in faith, one day while I was praying alone, some of my old acquaintances called me. At that moment, God gave me the strength to say, “The old me is dead.” In every situation, God was helping me. He called me to serve Him through the last verses of Matthew chapter 9.</p>
<p>When I came into ministry, I learned many things during my training at Mandavalli. The woman evangelist strengthened us spiritually. Now, I am serving in the place where God has called me to minister.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>Ours is a small village called N. Rameshwaram near Amalapuram. I am the only son to my parents. I have one elder sister and one younger sister. My father tried many times to make me study.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t focus on studies and because we earned well through my father’s profession of working in ponds, I wanted to make a lot of money. I got involved in politics, roamed around with friends, went to cinemas and brothels, drank alcohol, smoked cigarettes and beedis, and used to puff Deluxe 5000. I used to mix alcohol with food, blend cigarette powder with alcohol, smoke two or three cigarettes at a time—thus, I ruined my life.</p>
<p>In the name of love, I wandered around with girls. Because of earning a lot of money, my life was completely destroyed. Because of this lifestyle, my parents got me married.</p>
<p>After a few days, my wife gave birth to a son and a daughter. But as I went back to my old ways, my wife suffered from nerve weakness, blood pressure, and a state of depression. I used to beat and hurt her. I even had the desire to kill her and marry another woman.</p>
<p>However, through this fellowship, brothers came to our home and gave us the Testimony of the Evangelist book. My wife read the book and asked me to come to Mandavalli just once. I said I wouldn’t come, and that this was not our God, but some other god.</p>
<p>By then, my mother was suffering mentally and was sick. We had gone to many hospitals, but the doctors said she had to take tablets until death. We didn’t know what to do in such a situation.</p>
<p>I asked, "If there is a God, why do such situations arise?" I thought it would be better to die than suffer like this. At that time, in May 2011, because of my wife's insistence, I came to Mandavalli with her for the retreat.</p>
<p>After arriving there, I thought I would stay just for one day and return. But the Word of God gripped me. Immediately, I stayed and started praying. A feeling I had never known before overtook me.</p>
<p>God healed my wife. The weakness in her was gone. I was amazed. I realized God truly speaks. After a few days, I went for repentance.</p>
<p>God showed me every sin, and I confessed. God Himself gave me baptism. My heart felt light, joyful, and peaceful in a way I had never known before. Everything appeared new.</p>
<p>After a few days, while continuing in the ministry of God, He spoke through a vision to serve Him. Then, through the evangelist, I came to Mandavalli for training. I learned many spiritual truths through the evangelist.</p>
<p>Then, through a vision, God showed me a region. The Spiritual Mother sent me to that region. In that place, God strengthened me and is making ministry happen in many areas.</p>
<p>Please pray that I remain faithful to God and this fellowship till the end.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in lord,</p>
<p>I was born as the only son to Mr. Kathari Namcharayya and Mrs. Anjamma in the town of Gudivada, Krishna District. My parents came from a non-Christian background and had no knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Professionally, my father worked as a tailor in the same town, and we were leading a happy life without any lack. However, due to some financial reasons, my father moved to Vijayawada. My father used to continue his work in Vijayawada.</p>
<p>While working there, he developed a relationship with a woman who came to learn tailoring from him. Eventually, he abandoned my mother and me and left with that woman. Due to his absence, we were unable to pay my school fees, and I had to discontinue my studies. We even struggled for food, and my mother went into deep mental distress.</p>
<p>During that time, a woman living near our house invited my mother to church. On that first Sunday, God comforted her through the Word during the worship service. That was the beginning of my mother's spiritual journey toward accepting the Lord.</p>
<p>Because of our financial situation, I was sent to a hostel in Kaikaluru. Even as a child, I was used to lying to my mother, pretending to go to school while actually skipping classes and watching movies.</p>
<p>After joining the hostel, things got worse. I got into bad habits like watching inappropriate movies, stealing, and telling lies. Sin entered my heart and body through these habits, and I began to destroy myself physically. I eventually developed nerve weakness and had to leave the Kaikaluru hostel and continue my studies in Vijayawada, where I joined 10th grade.</p>
<p>During this time, my mother passed away due to illness. With no one left to support me, I stayed at my mother sister's house and completed my 10th-grade education. While studying Intermediate (11th–12th grade), I was led by worldly desires and continued to ruin my body further.</p>
<p>When my mother was alive, I had no bad addictions. But after her death, I lost the fear that had kept me in check. I started riding bikes recklessly, drinking alcohol, smoking, fighting in college, watching excessive movies, distributing inappropriate CDs to others and corrupting them, visiting immoral places, and having physical relationships with women under the name of love. I even denied Christ and began to say that all gods are the same. I became a person who rebelled against God completely. Due to this sinful lifestyle, I suffered from health issues. My uncle took me to the hospital, and after I recovered, he wanted to arrange my marriage, thinking I shouldn't live alone. At that point, Bro. Abraham took responsibility and got me married.</p>
<p>Even after marriage, I didn’t change. I used to confess my past affairs to my wife, causing her emotional pain. In spite of this, God blessed us with two children.</p>
<p>Later, I began suspecting my wife. This suspicion became a monster that began to consume our lives. At that time, Brother from the Holy Army Fellowship came to minister in Vijayawada.</p>
<p>He visited our home regularly, though we never shared our problems with him. Due to my suspicions, my wife attempted suicide twice. I even had thoughts of killing her.</p>
<p>There was no peace in our family. One day, I went to a fellowship meeting with the Evangelist. There, a brother shared his testimony about how suspicion had led him to almost kill his wife. That testimony deeply moved me.</p>
<p>I confessed my sins to the Evangelist, and he, along with others, counseled my wife and me and asked us to come to Mandavalli. At that time, I didn’t even know how to pray. The Evangelist taught me how to pray.</p>
<p>After praying for three days, I confessed all the sins I was aware of but still didn’t feel God speaking to me. The Evangelist told me that there may be unknown sins and encouraged me to ask God to reveal them. When God revealed those hidden sins, I confessed them as well. Then, the work of the Holy Spirit began in me, and I experienced true repentance.</p>
<p>When I confessed everything, God spoke to me and said, “Your sins are forgiven.” I saw a black cloud leaving my body, and I was filled with great joy. From that day, the evil spirit of suspicion left me, and peace and happiness returned to my life.</p>
<p>I also returned everything I had stolen. When God convicted me that traveling without a train ticket was a sin, I went back and paid the railway authorities. God not only helped me reconcile with Him but also helped me make things right with people.</p>
<p>After some time in the faith life, God spoke to me to enter into His service. I left my job and went to Mandavalli for training. After completing part of the training, I stepped into full-time ministry.</p>
<p>Since then, I have remained faithful in God’s ministry. May this testimony be a blessing to many.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>We are from Thakkellapadu village, Mandavalli Mandal, Eluru district. I was born into a nominal Christian family. Our ancestors did not know the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>My paternal grandmother's sister shared the gospel with our family. Though initially rejected, she later accepted the Lord Jesus Christ and put her faith in Him. From then on, we began attending church and participating in Christian meetings. From childhood, I continued in this path.</p>
<p>I used to attend Sunday school and memorize Bible verses. Although I went regularly, there was no real change in my life. From childhood, I was a liar, a thief, I used foul language, disobeyed my parents, and lived in a way that dishonored God.</p>
<p>At school, I would steal my classmates' belongings and cause them pain. Sin grew increasingly in my life. After reaching high school, I began going to movies and lying to my parents to get money, pretending it was for school fees, and spending it on movies.</p>
<p>I also influenced my friends in a negative way. Together with my friends, I would go to movies. Outwardly, I pretended to be good, and others thought I was a nice boy, but there was no goodness in me.</p>
<p>Watching inappropriate content corrupted my thoughts. I developed impure thoughts whenever I saw a woman. While I continued living this way, an evangelist named Mandavalli Abraham used to conduct Christian meetings in our village.</p>
<p>My uncle Yesu and I would attend those meetings. Since the meetings were organized by our relatives, we joined them in ministry. My uncle had come to Mandavalli through friends and experienced repentance.</p>
<p>He explained the meaning of repentance to me. I was afraid when I heard his words and desired to repent, but I thought I should first leave all my sins and only then go to Mandavalli to repent. However, I was unable to leave my sins.</p>
<p>I lived more deeply in sin. While I was living without peace, the evangelist who was mentoring my uncle came to our house. Out of love, he invited me and another brother to come to Mandavalli and experience repentance.</p>
<p>Though I refused initially, they did not give up on me. Then, burdened in heart, I joined them and went. At Mandavalli, I participated in prayers. Some of the time I prayed, and the rest of the time I wasted talking to others.</p>
<p>Then the evangelists encouraged me to pray sincerely. Since I had been participating in family prayer since childhood, I had pride in thinking I already knew everything. However, they taught me how to pray with love and sincerity. One day, a spiritual mother sternly asked us, “Did you come here to pray or just to talk?”</p>
<p>Her correction made me spend more time in prayer. From then, a desire for God grew in me. I continued in prayer, and as I did, God reminded me of my entire past life. While I continued praying, God gave me a vision. In the vision, I saw a narrow path lined with trees on both sides. I was walking on this path.</p>
<p>As I walked, I began to sink—ankle deep, knee deep, waist deep, and then neck deep—in what It was the I realized I had fallen into a swamp. I tried best to come out of it,but I couldn't. There was no one around to help me.</p>
<p>At that point, I looked up to the sky and cried out, “Lord!” Suddenly, the heavens opened, and two hands extended down. A golden ladder descended from those hands into the swamp. I used the ladder to climb out.</p>
<p>When I looked at myself, there was no mud or dirt on me. Then I realized, according to Psalm 40:1–2, that the Lord had delivered me from the pit of sin.</p>
<p>As I continued in prayer, I wasn’t someone who prayed aloud. I feared that if I confessed my sins out loud, others might judge me. But one day, I was alone in a room praying. The Holy Spirit touched me, and I wept loudly, confessing all my sins.</p>
<p>Regardless of what others thought, I openly admitted and hated my sins. As the Holy Spirit touched me, great peace and comfort filled my heart.</p>
<p>After several days of prayer, even the natural environment around me began to look new and fresh. The Word says, “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation”—and this became true in my life.</p>
<p>According to the Word of God and with the guidance of the evangelists, I set my heart right before God and before people. I returned everything I had wrongfully taken and reconciled with those I had hurt. In doing so, I experienced divine joy.</p>
<p>According to the call of God, I am continuing in His ministry. Please pray with love that I and my family remain faithful in this ministry till the end.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is T. Veerraju. I am from a village called Podu in Krishna District. I was born into a family that did not know God. We had no knowledge about the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>During my childhood, my mother fell ill. She was devoted to various non-Christian religious practices, but even then, her health did not improve. We visited many hospitals, but her condition remained the same.</p>
<p>One day, a Christian sister came and shared about the Lord Jesus Christ. We did not accept her words at first because we had no understanding of who Jesus was. She said that if we believed in Jesus, my mother would be healed. Still, we did not listen. However, when my mother’s condition became critical, we finally went to a church, as she had said.</p>
<p>God healed my mother. From that moment on, we began to believe in Jesus. Whenever I fell sick, my mother would pray, and I would be healed. That’s when my faith in the Lord Jesus began to grow.</p>
<p>Later, I got married. For three years, we had no children. Then, God blessed us with two children. Yet, I lived a nominal Christian life. I was involved in elections, fights, alcohol, adultery — such was my lifestyle.</p>
<p>I had a desire to be more devout. I fasted and prayed for 40 days, attended spiritual gatherings, and even took baptism. But still, there was no change in my life. I found no peace, no joy. I visited many churches in search of devotion, but my life remained the same.</p>
<p>Due to losses in the ponds I managed, I became sorrowful. One night, I had a vision of a man dressed in white who appeared to me and said, “If you believe in Jesus, you must not sin, you must not drink, you must live righteously.” Then he disappeared. But my life was full of those very things.</p>
<p>From that time, I desired earnestly to live a devoted life. I hoped to meet a great servant of God. A brother then told me about Brother Abraham in Mandavalli. He said that, It rained when he asked to rain and It stopped when he asked it to stop. Hope arose, and I went to Mandavalli and prayed</p>
<p>As I was praying, “Lord, protect them,” Bro.Abraham came and asked, “Have you protected yourself first?” I asked, “What do you mean, brother?” He replied, “You must confess the sins you’ve committed since your childhood.”</p>
<p>I began to confess my sins. Then a great light appeared before me. That light touched a man, and God said, “That man has repented.” I prayed, “Lord, let that light touch me too.”</p>
<p>Then that light touched me. Brother called us and said, “You have now received repentance. Go home, live separately, righteously, honestly, and in holiness. Reject sin as you would reject a hen potty. Each of you should lead 100 people to repentance.”</p>
<p>I said, “, I am uneducated. How can I lead others?” He asked, “Why not?” I replied, “Because I’m not educated.” He said, “If you are not educated, then simply share what you have seen here, what you have done in fellowship, what you have heard, and how your life has changed. That itself is the Gospel.”</p>
<p>After returning home, I made peace with everyone. I decided firmly to fast and pray with my wife every Wednesday, praying that a servant of God would come to serve our area.</p>
<p>One day, due to financial struggles, my wife asked me to bring some salt. I had no money. As I was walking, I saw a pond with salt. I took some without asking. But I was afraid. I hid the salt by a wall and prayed.</p>
<p>That night, a man dressed in white came and asked, “Veerraju, where did you get this salt from?” I said, “It belongs to others, but they don’t need it, so I took it.” He replied, “If they don’t need it, why did you take it? This darkness is coming upon you because of that.” I immediately took the salt back and threw it where I found it.</p>
<p>The people there asked, “Why did you bring it back?” I told them, “I went to Mandavalli, repented, and God warned me.” They were amazed. Later, in prayer, God showed me singing songs and preaching the Gospel.</p>
<p>Just as Brother Abraham had said, many people from our area repented as I shared about my life and what I had seen and heard in fellowship. I asked Brother Abraham, “Please come and serve in our area.” He said, “You are the servant.”</p>
<p>I said, “But I am not educated.” He replied, “Peter and John were also uneducated. Be faithful to God and the fellowship. God will use you.”</p>
<p>Following his words and by God’s grace, I began to serve in the area God had shown me.</p>
<p>At that time, my wife struggled a lot. I told her, “God will provide.” She would ask, “Where will He provide from?” That night, God spoke to her through Matthew 6:6. Since then, she never opposed me again.</p>
<p>Because of my faith, during a meeting, God gave me a Bible and told me to share His Word. Later, my mother-in-law fell ill. Doctors said her blood was changing and that she would die. We brought her to Mandavalli. The men of God prayed, and her weakness left.</p>
<p>Due to our financial condition, relatives sent me to sea fishing. One night, a terrible storm arose. I cried, “Lord, bring me back safely. I will serve You.”</p>
<p>As people prayed for me, God said, “Send My son tomorrow, or I will cast him into the river.” My wife said she would go to her mother’s house. I agreed.</p>
<p>I was thinking of sinning that night. But God came and anointed me with oil in a vision. From then, I walked in the Lord. Later, my wife returned to her mother’s house. I had a desire to return to the worldly life.</p>
<p>Then I was struck with chills and fever. I asked, “Lord, why have I fallen into this sinful desire?” Then God, clothed in white, appeared and said, “My son, you were ready to turn away despite hearing My Word. Even if you lead others, I will not spare you. Many will change because of you. That is why I have appointed you in this village.”</p>
<p>“If you seek My righteousness and My kingdom, I will lift you to a high place. Otherwise, leprosy will come upon you.” I fell down, crying, “Lord, I don’t want leprosy.” I took ten mustard seeds and said, “Even if I die, I will die at Your feet.” My children and I made a covenant with God.</p>
<p>Later, during a servants’ gathering, the men of God rebuked us. I wondered if it was even possible to be devoted. Then I feared that I might get leprosy. Brother Abraham saw me and said, “You are a servant. Come to the servants’ gathering.”</p>
<p>I said, “Brother, I’m not educated.” He replied, “Peter and John weren’t educated either. Be faithful to God and the fellowship. God will use you.”</p>
<p>According to the words of the servants of God and by His grace, I am now serving in the area He showed me.</p>
<p>Please continue to pray that I may remain faithful to God and the fellowship.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Prasanna Kumar. I was born as the eldest son to Venkateswara Rao and Aruna Kumari in a small village called Venugopalapuram in the Diviseema region.</p>
<p>When my parents were told that if they believed in the Lord Jesus Christ their sicknesses would be healed, they accepted Him and experienced His goodness. In gratitude, they built a church next to our home. During my childhood, my parents were baptized and regularly attended church. However, later, my mother developed a condition called nerve weakness. All of my father's income was spent on her hospital bills. He would often quarrel with my mother, saying, “All the money is being spent on you,” and because of this, there was no peace, joy, or comfort in our home.</p>
<p>I too grew up with pride and disobedience, never listening to my parents. Though I attended church every Sunday, I lacked true spiritual understanding. I became a slave to various addictions — watching movies, drinking, partying, and spending time with friends in worldly pleasures.</p>
<p>In search of happiness, I went to parks, beaches, parties, and trips with girls. But I never found true joy. Though I went to church, my thoughts and mind were increasingly defiled. I knew that what I was doing and thinking was wrong, but I couldn’t overcome it.</p>
<p>I heard that many great evangelists were visiting different places, and I would go hoping my life would change. But my life remained the same.</p>
<p>One day, a pastor from West Godavari district came to our village for a meeting. While speaking to me, he said, “Brother, before baptism, you must first experience repentance. Only then will God speak to you and transform your life. No matter how many times you are immersed in water, only your name may change, not your life. First, repent.” He told me about the Holy Army Fellowship in Mandavalli and encouraged me to attend the repentance gatherings.</p>
<p>I went. During the repentance prayer, God reminded me of everything I had done since childhood — thefts, the many times I hurt my parents, how I beat my younger brother, the movies I watched, the sinful wandering with girls, the pleasures I enjoyed, the sins in my thoughts and mind, the arguments, and the curses I uttered in my heart. When I realized all of these, I confessed them before God and before the evangelists.</p>
<p>During that time, God showed me a vision and said, “I have washed you like a little child.” From then on, my thoughts, my mind, and my behavior began to change.</p>
<p>Later, one evangelist called and said, “Brother, God has a plan for every person. Not everyone who says, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but only those who do the will of the Father. Ask what His will is for your life.”</p>
<p>As I prayed for several days, God showed me in a vision that I must serve Him. I asked, “Lord, where should I go to serve You?” God said, “There is true devotion in the Holy Army Fellowship — go there.” So I joined the fellowship for evangelism training.</p>
<p>There, I came to know many things and developed a closer relationship with God. One day, God said to me, “I have forgiven all your sins, but you must also make things right with people. You have hurt, cursed, and even desired to kill many — go and ask them for forgiveness.” So I went to each one — childhood friends, teachers, college mates — and made things right.</p>
<p>After completing my evangelism training, I began serving in the area where God had directed me, according to His will.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

            <div class="testimony-full">
              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Hanok, and I come from a small village near Amalapuram. I was born into a Hindu family and had no knowledge of Jesus Christ. In fact, whenever God’s servants came to our village, I used to mock and insult them.</p>
<p>Even though I had everything in life, I had one strong desire — to learn tailoring. But my parents did not support that dream. So, I decided to leave the village. I sold my mother’s gold and went to Mumbai, where I lived for 18 years.</p>
<p>When I eventually returned home, I found that both my parents had passed away.</p>
<p>I have two elder brothers and one sister. They decided to get me married and arranged my marriage with my cousin — my maternal uncle’s daughter.</p>
<p>Later, I moved to Hyderabad for work. During that time, I experienced a health issue, and when I consulted a doctor, he told me that I was HIV positive. That news brought a deep fear of death into my heart.</p>
<p>My wife told me, “If you believe in Jesus Christ, He can heal you.” But I had always been someone who blasphemed Jesus.</p>
<p>One day, after an argument at home, I was walking outside in sadness. Nearby, a gospel meeting was going on. A preacher was sharing his salvation testimony, and as I listened, a desire to know Jesus began to stir in my heart.</p>
<p>With my wife's encouragement, I went to a nearby church. While I was there, a bright light touched me — I couldn’t understand what it was at the time. Later, I went back to the doctor, and to my surprise, the report showed that I was HIV negative!</p>
<p>After that, I longed to know true devotion, so I started visiting several churches. But I was disappointed by the behavior and practices I saw in many places and began to wonder, “How can people who believe in God live like this?”</p>
<p>Later, I returned to my native village, and through a sister in Christ, I was introduced to Holy Army Fellowship. The brothers there told me, “You need to truly repent.” I asked them, “What is repentance?” and they replied, “Repentance means confessing every sin and turning away from it.”</p>
<p>One day, Brother Johny from Holy Army Fellowship came to our village. He shared his testimony and explained repentance in detail. I then decided to attend the repentance meetings.</p>
<p>At the meeting, I confessed every known sin from my life. God even reminded me of sins I had forgotten. I wept with deep sorrow, repented, and asked God for forgiveness. After that, my heart felt light, and I was filled with great joy.</p>
<p>At that moment, I made a decision — if I live, I will live for God. I stayed there for some time, helping in sharing the gospel.</p>
<p>Later, God called me into His service. I went to the main center of Holy Army Fellowship in Mandavalli and spent a year in ministry training, where I learned many spiritual truths.</p>
<p>After prayer, God showed me a place to go for ministry. In that ministry, God did many miracles and saved many souls.</p>
<p>Now, by the grace of God, I continue to serve Him in the ministry.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Suresh, and I am from SC Peta, near Nuzvid. My parents had six children, and I am the youngest among them.</p>
<p>Although my parents used to attend church, there was no real transformation in their lives. As a result, my own life—from childhood to youth—was filled with lies and theft.</p>
<p>As I grew older, my thoughts, eyes, and mind became increasingly corrupt, and I fell into sin with a married woman. Eventually, her husband found out and caught me. He was about to kill me, but thanks to the intervention of a compassionate woman, I was released. That incident left a deep scar in my heart—especially when my mother and sisters were insulted because of my sin. From that moment, I decided: “I want to live a life that pleases God.”</p>
<p>Later, I got married, and we began attending a church with seven branches. Both my wife and I took baptism there. We were blessed with a son and a daughter. I participated regularly in Holy Communion, yet I still did not live a victorious Christian life.</p>
<p>One day, a friend invited me to a meeting. There, a pastor baptized me again and even changed my name. Because of my interest, I joined Bible classes and received a pastoral certificate. But still, victory over sin eluded me.</p>
<p>Eventually, I fell back into sin—adultery, drinking, smoking, marijuana, watching immoral movies, keeping bad company, and stealing. My wife and I had no peace or joy at home. In front of my relatives and parents, I acted like a good person, but in reality, my life had sunk to the level of a dog.</p>
<p>Burdened by my sin, I was even ready to divorce my wife. At that time, God's servants from Mandavalli came to our area for a memorial gathering. They spoke to me personally and said, “If you truly repent, God will speak to you.”</p>
<p>For the first time, I attended an All-Night Prayer Meeting in Mandavalli. There, the Word of God and the love shown by the servants deeply moved me. In January 2015, I heard about a Repentance Gathering and attended it along with my wife.</p>
<p>God’s servants encouraged us, saying, “Confess every sin you have committed—from your childhood until now.” As I fasted and prayed, the Lord began to reveal every sin I had ever committed. I was filled with deep sorrow and repentance. I cried out, “I am unworthy to live because of the wicked life I’ve led.”</p>
<p>After spending 12 days in the church, confessing and correcting my life, God gave me a victorious life. He brought peace into my heart. I was also able to repay a debt of 1 million rupees. I went to those I had wronged, apologized, and returned what I had stolen.</p>
<p>Then, God called me into His service. Now, by His grace and according to His will, I am faithfully serving Him.</p>
<p>I humbly ask for your prayers, that my family and I may remain faithful to God and to the fellowship until the end.</p>
<p>With this, I conclude my testimony.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

            <div class="testimony-full">
              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Praveen Kumar. I was born as the second child to my parents after 14 years of waiting.</p>
<p>From the beginning, my parents knew the Lord Jesus. However, my father became addicted to alcohol, and although he practiced outward devotion, he could not give up drinking. Because of this, our family lacked peace and joy.</p>
<p>My mother, on the other hand, had a deep desire to live a truly devout life. From childhood, I used to go to church, but I continued living a worldly life.</p>
<p>As I entered my youth and joined college, I spent most of my time with friends, wandering in worldly ways. My father became even more entangled in worldly habits, and our family continued to suffer because of it.</p>
<p>Longing for spiritual life, my mother began visiting five different churches in our village. She even took baptism twice, desiring a devout life — but still, there was no peace in our home.</p>
<p>Then evangelists from the Holy Army Fellowship came to our village and shared the Gospel with my parents. But my father refused to accept their message.</p>
<p>My mother, holding onto hope, accepted the Gospel of repentance and decided to go to Mandavalli to receive repentance. My father threatened her and said, “If you go, I will make you roam the streets without clothes.”</p>
<p>Still, she went to Mandavalli. For six days, she confessed and surrendered her sins before God — and the Lord visited her during that time.</p>
<p>When she returned home, she fell at my father’s feet and asked for forgiveness. This shocked him. She then went to every person in the village and sought their forgiveness.</p>
<p>A few months later, the same evangelists sent me to attend a repentance gathering in Mandavalli. While I was in the process of repenting, my father called and lied, saying my mother was dying, just to bring me back.</p>
<p>However, a few months later, my father died from an electric shock right at home. It was a great tragedy for us.</p>
<p>During his burial, the church our family had previously attended refused to conduct the burial because my mother was now attending another church. At that time, the evangelists from the Holy Army Fellowship lovingly took responsibility and conducted the burial themselves. Their love was priceless.</p>
<p>That moment became a turning point for me. I asked, “My mother is living a devout life — why didn’t God save my father?” I prayed and said, “God, if You truly exist, You must speak to me.” But He did not speak.</p>
<p>Out of anger, I blasphemed. I even kicked the Bible with my foot and said that Jesus does not exist.</p>
<p>After my father’s death, the people living near our house began to insult and trouble us. Seeing this hardship, I decided to earn money. I left college and started working hard. But I also got involved in watching filthy movies and living a life of deep sin.</p>
<p>I became the SFI president of my college, leading 400 students — living like a rowdy, surrounded by bad company, and walking in total darkness.</p>
<p>During this time, I fell in love with a girl and decided to marry her.</p>
<p>Then some evangelists came to me and shared the Gospel of repentance. They said, “If you repent, God will speak to you.” That gave me hope. One day, I went to the Holy Army Fellowship church.</p>
<p>There, I listened to an audio message by a righteous man. He said, “God helped me live without letting even my little finger be defiled by sin,” and “God spoke to me.”</p>
<p>Those words challenged me deeply. Holding onto the promise that God speaks, I went to Mandavalli. There, they told me, “If you confess your sins, God will speak to you.”</p>
<p>I began confessing my sins. God began to reveal even the most secret sins I had forgotten. When I confessed them all with tears, my heart felt light, and I was filled with great joy. God visited me.</p>
<p>From that moment on, whenever I saw a woman, the Lord helped me look at her with purity. I went back to people I had stolen from or hurt and asked them for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Concerning the girl I had loved, the Lord revealed that she had already been defiled by others. So I let her go.</p>
<p>Although I had studied dishonestly, I still ranked first in college. But when I told my mother that I wanted to live for God, she made me take a vow, saying, “You must live for the God who gave His Word in the Bible and died for you.”</p>
<p>I left everything and dedicated my life to God’s service. One night in prayer, God called me to His work. I left my studies, and the evangelists sent my mother and me to Mandavalli for spiritual training.</p>
<p>At the Holy Army Fellowship compound, the spiritual mother of the house taught me about fellowship with God, faith, and the life of prayer. Brother Isaac showed me a love that even my relatives never showed.</p>
<p>He loved me like a father. The spiritual mother arranged my marriage. I saw my wife for the first time on our wedding stage. She didn’t even know who I was, but God had already revealed my name and where I was from.</p>
<p>She is the daughter of a faithful evangelist, a devout woman who loves me dearly. The spiritual mother then sent me to a new area to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>Please continue to pray for me as I serve the Lord in faith.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Raja Ratnam, and I am from Batlapalem village near Amalapuram.</p>
<p>I was born into a family that did not know the Lord. My parents had four children, and I am the eldest. My father became addicted to alcohol, which led to many problems in our family and eventually resulted in his death.</p>
<p>Later, when we approached our relatives for financial help for my sister’s marriage, they said, “We can give you advice, but how can we help with money?” So we returned home disappointed.</p>
<p>Some time later, I went to Maharashtra for work. While I was earning there, I was able to arrange the marriages of two of my sisters. However, during that time, I ended up ruining my own life through sinful choices.</p>
<p>Eventually, I returned to my village, but my mother came to know about the sinful life I had been living. I tried many times to change myself, but I failed.</p>
<p>Seeing my condition, my mother arranged my marriage with my cousin. For about five months, things went well. But soon I began spending time with friends, watching movies late into the night, and living carelessly. This created tension and took away the peace between me and my wife.</p>
<p>At one point, I lost all hope and decided to end my life. I crushed glass bottles and tried to swallow the shards. I also attempted to hang myself from a ceiling fan.</p>
<p>In that terrible situation, the Gospel was shared with us through my sister’s husband. But I refused to listen.</p>
<p>However, one day, my wife went into the Lord’s presence in prayer. Because of that prayer, I had a vision that night — I saw the Lord Jesus, clothed in white garments.</p>
<p>Later, my wife, our two sons, and I went to the Holy Army Fellowship to receive repentance.</p>
<p>The evangelists there told us, “Confess every single sin, because the Lord Jesus died for our sins.”</p>
<p>As I was confessing, I had a vision in which I was being run over by two trucks. When I asked the Lord what it meant, He said, “These are the sins of your parents and your own sins.”</p>
<p>Then I repented with deep sorrow and confessed all my sins — drinking, stealing, cheating, lying, smoking, gambling, watching filthy movies, and insulting and hitting my mother and wife — I laid everything before the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord began to speak to me. I was filled with great joy, and God restored peace between me and my wife.</p>
<p>He gave me complete victory over every addiction and totally transformed my life.</p>
<p>After my transformation, the Lord called me to serve Him.</p>
<p>However, I did not obey immediately. Because of my disobedience, sickness struck my family. When I prayed, the Lord said, “If you do My work, I will take care of yours.”</p>
<p>Then the Lord led me into His service.</p>
<p>I went to Mandavalli for ministry training. There, the Lord revealed the Uppada region as the place where I should serve. Spiritual Mother strengthened us and sent us to minister in that region.</p>
<p>Until now, by His grace, we have remained faithful in fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Please continue to pray for my family, that we may remain faithful in His service.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Rajesh. I was born as the first child to my parents in a small village near Tiruvuru town in Krishna District. I have two younger brothers.</p>
<p>I was born into a family that did not know the love or the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Due to a certain health issue my mother faced, a few brothers came and shared the Gospel with her. They said that if she believed in the Lord and attended church, the Lord would heal her. As a result, my mother began attending church — and the Lord graciously healed her.</p>
<p>From then on, my mother and one of my younger brothers started going to church regularly. They would invite me as well, but I was unwilling to go.</p>
<p>My father did not have a good opinion of the Lord or of those who believed in Him. Though he worked hard, he was addicted to alcohol. Because of his suspicious nature and constant quarrels, he often scolded and fought with my mother. Our home lacked peace, joy, and rest.</p>
<p>Since childhood, I never had any outward addictions like alcohol or smoking. I always wanted to live a good and moral life. But inwardly, my thoughts, emotions, and eyes were filled with sin and corruption.</p>
<p>The movies I watched and the images I was exposed to further worsened the condition of my heart. A question would often echo within me:
“You want to live a good life and be a good person — then why are your eyes, thoughts, and mind filled with corruption?”</p>
<p>Even though I longed to live a holy life, my heart remained defiled. During my college years, I fell into a sinful and worldly relationship. I disrespected my parents and caused them much sorrow.</p>
<p>After completing my studies, by God’s grace, I was married to a girl who knew the Lord. Though I began going to church with my wife, my life remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Later, God blessed us with a son. When our child developed some health issues, evangelists from the Holy Army Fellowship came and prayed. The Lord healed our child, and through that healing, the Gospel entered our home.</p>
<p>When we heard that forgiveness of sins and victory over sin come through repentance, we decided to go to Mandavalli to receive repentance.</p>
<p>I confessed all the sins I could remember. The evangelists told me, “Ask the Lord to remind you of the sins you’ve forgotten.” As I prayed, the Lord began revealing every sin I had committed since childhood.</p>
<p>I began confessing even the smallest of sins. Then, the Lord appeared to me and said, “I have forgiven your sins.”</p>
<p>Through my testimony, my father, mother, and younger brothers also went to Mandavalli and received repentance.</p>
<p>As I continued in faith, the Lord called me into His service. At first, I was afraid and did not go. But later, through His promises and strength, I came for training.</p>
<p>By God’s grace, I completed the training, and today I am serving in the region the Lord has appointed for me.</p>
<p>Until the end, please continue to pray for me and my family — that we may remain faithful in fellowship with God and in His service.</p>

              <p>My name is Ratna Kumar, and I come from a village called Geddanapalli, near Amalapuram. I was born into a family that did not know the Lord.</p>
<p>My parents had three children, and I am the youngest. However, my father was addicted to alcohol, and because of that, there was no peace in our home.</p>
<p>Due to the constant turmoil in the family, I often spoke harshly to my father. My parents, burdened by our financial struggles, would frequently leave the village to find work elsewhere.</p>
<p>During that time, I stayed behind in the village to continue my studies. Watching my parents struggle, I had a desire to study well and become successful in life.</p>
<p>However, because of bad friendships, I could not focus on my studies and ended up picking up many wrong habits.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, my father fell ill and eventually passed away. Some time later, my mother began to believe in the Lord Jesus and started attending church.</p>
<p>At first, there wasn’t any visible change in her life. Still, she would urge me to believe in Jesus. But I rejected her words and even spoke against the Lord.</p>
<p>Due to our financial difficulties, I took up a job at a company. But whatever salary I earned was wasted on bad habits and addictions.</p>
<p>Eventually, for various reasons, I quit my job. Soon after, I developed a serious health issue. A thorn from a poisonous plant pierced my leg, leading to a severe infection that troubled me for two years.</p>
<p>During that painful period, I began to feel a need to believe in the Lord Jesus. Around that time, I heard the Gospel through the Holy Army Fellowship.</p>
<p>They spoke to me about repentance and told me that the Lord could transform my life. Holding on to that hope, I came into the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>After some time, the Lord helped me truly repent. During that season of repentance, as I prayed, the Lord began to reveal every sin I had committed.</p>
<p>From thefts, immorality, drinking, gambling, lying, and deceit — the Lord helped me understand the weight of all my sins. I was filled with godly sorrow and cried out to the Lord, asking for His forgiveness.</p>
<p>Then the Lord confirmed that He had forgiven my sins. My heart was filled with peace, joy, and relief — a joy that only the Lord can give.</p>
<p>Since then, I have had a desire to serve the Lord. As I continued in prayer, the Lord called me into His ministry.</p>
<p>As I grew in faith, the Lord began to do many works in my life. On one occasion, He even saved me from a terrible accident.</p>
<p>As my spiritual journey continued, I came to Mandavalli, where I learned many things in the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>After completing my training, I was sent to the place the Lord showed me to serve in ministry.</p>
<p>By His grace, I am currently continuing in the Lord’s service there.</p>
<p>Until the end, please pray that my family and I may remain faithful to the Lord and in fellowship with Him.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is S. Paul. I was born as the second child to my parents in Enikepadu, a village near Vijayawada.</p>
<p>I come from a nominal Christian family. My father was addicted to gambling and playing cards. He would lose all his money and come home, which led to constant arguments and unrest between my parents.</p>
<p>During those times, my mother would leave the house and go to her parental home. Because of this ongoing conflict and instability, my parents were not living together consistently, and I was unable to continue my education properly.</p>
<p>As I entered my youth, I began spending time with the wrong friends and fell into sinful habits such as smoking, drinking, and leading an immoral lifestyle.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got married in a Christian ceremony, but there was still no change in my life. At one point, we moved to another village, and there I fell seriously ill.</p>
<p>The illness was so severe that even after consulting many spiritual healers, there was no relief.</p>
<p>Later, we moved to a village called Ganguru. Though my parents identified as Christians and regularly attended church, there was no real transformation in their lives.</p>
<p>During that time, servants of God from the Holy Army Fellowship visited our home and shared the Gospel of repentance with my mother. She later went to Mandavalli, where she confessed all her sins before the Lord and experienced true repentance.</p>
<p>After returning home, she knelt before me and asked for forgiveness. That transformation deeply impacted me—it was a moment of great surprise and conviction.</p>
<p>Later, my mother took me to meet those same servants of God, and they also shared the message of repentance with me.</p>
<p>On one occasion, God’s servant Brother Abraham visited our village. A large group of us had gathered to hear him. During his message, he said, “Why are so many people still bound in sin? Let us pray for them.”</p>
<p>That simple sentence struck me deeply. The word he shared had a powerful impact on my heart.</p>
<p>As a result, we went to Mandavalli for repentance. There, as we began to confess our sins, the Lord revealed even those we had forgotten. We wept bitterly and laid everything before Him. Our hearts were lightened, and we were filled with great joy.</p>
<p>The Lord gave me a promise from Psalm 128, which brought much encouragement. Around the same time, my wife also received the grace to repent.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Lord called both my wife and me into His ministry. As we continued in prayer, the Lord revealed that we should go to the city of Nellore to serve Him.</p>
<p>In obedience to the Lord’s voice, we went to that city with no human support, relying solely on His guidance. There, amidst many trials and challenges, the Lord began to do His mighty works—strengthening us and establishing His ministry.</p>
<p>Together with my family, I continue to serve faithfully in His fellowship. Please remember us in your prayers, that we may remain faithful to the Lord until the very end.</p>
<p>With this, I conclude my brief testimony.</p>

<p>I was born into a family that did not know God. I used to mock the name of Jesus Christ, saying, “He is not our God.”</p>
<p>During my student days, I had a strong desire to earn a lot of money. With that goal in mind, I traveled to various states and earned well.</p>
<p>Later, my parents arranged my marriage, and we were blessed with a baby boy. However, our son was born with a severe health condition. We took him to several hospitals and visited many places seeking treatment, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>Though my wife believed in God and used to pray, I didn’t like it. In fact, I would often speak harshly to her and mock her faith.</p>
<p>During this very difficult period, the Gospel was brought to our family through the Holy Army Fellowship.</p>
<p>My parents received the Gospel and repented. They would share this good news with me, but I refused to listen.</p>
<p>Later, I traveled to another region for work. There, due to several difficult circumstances, I was led to repentance.</p>
<p>As I prayed, God began to show me my sins—stealing, deceit, lying, cockfighting, and the many lives I had hurt and ruined. I was convicted, deeply repented, and confessed all those sins before the Lord.</p>
<p>Then, God gave me the assurance that my sins were forgiven. My heart was filled with great peace and joy.</p>
<p>After that, I returned to my village, asked my parents for forgiveness, returned the things I had stolen, and reconciled with many people I had hurt.</p>
<p>Since the time of my repentance, God miraculously healed my son from his severe condition.</p>
<p>God called me several times to serve Him, but I did not submit. Then, my father fell seriously ill. We took him to many hospitals, but the doctors said there was no hope. We brought him back to our village.</p>
<p>At that time, I prayed earnestly, “Lord, if You give life to my father, I will serve You.” And God miraculously healed him.</p>
<p>That day, I fully surrendered myself to God’s service and went to the Headquarters in Mandavalli for ministry training.</p>
<p>During the training, God taught me many spiritual truths. According to His will, and under the guidance of Spiritual Mother, I was sent into the ministry.</p>
<p>Now, by His grace, I am faithfully serving the Lord in the area He has appointed for me.</p>
<p>I humbly request your prayers for me and my family—that we may remain faithful to God and to the Fellowship until the end.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>
<p>Sajeev</p>

            <div class="testimony-full">
              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Suribabu, and I was born in the village of Parrapeta, near Amalapuram. My parents had three sons and one daughter—I am the youngest.</p>
<p>I was born into a family that did not know the Lord Jesus. In fact, I used to mock anyone who accepted Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>From childhood, there was never peace between my parents—constant fights filled our home. I used to cry and wonder, “Why was I born into such a family?”</p>
<p>As I grew older, I began lying, stealing, and going to movies. Slowly, my thoughts and desires became corrupt. I became addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, and violence. My father, my brother, and I used to drink together—none of them ever corrected me. I would come home drunk and beat my parents.</p>
<p>One evening, while returning home drunk, a neighbor told me that my father had brought another woman home. I told my mother, and she replied, “It’s better if such a man dies.” With those words echoing in my heart, I gave my father alcohol, drank with him, and then took him to the Godavari Bridge—there, I threw him into the river.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, I returned home and told my mother what I had done. She broke down in tears. We didn’t tell my brothers or any relatives. But three days later, the police came to our house.</p>
<p>At that moment, I had just sat down to eat. They asked, “Where is your father?” I said I didn’t know. But they took me to the police station.</p>
<p>As I entered, to my shock, I saw my father sitting there—I was overwhelmed with unexpected joy. But then, to my horror, my father filed a case against me, and I was arrested. An FIR was registered, and I spent 21 days in jail.</p>
<p>When I returned home, people mocked and scolded me. No one wanted to give me their daughter in marriage.</p>
<p>One day, during a Christian wedding in our village, an elder said, “We have a girl—consider this alliance.” And that is how I got married.</p>
<p>My wife, a believer in Jesus, used to urge me to come to the Lord. One Sunday, our daughter developed a fever. Though we rushed her to the hospital, she passed away on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Three days later, my wife said, “I will go into the presence of the Lord. He gave her, and He has taken her.” She encouraged me to seek God.</p>
<p>At that time, I still did not know the Lord. But my wife kept inviting me to church. Eventually, I went—and after three weeks, I took baptism.</p>
<p>However, even after that, there was no peace in our home. I even considered killing my wife and marrying someone else.</p>
<p>It was during this dark time that I encountered the Holy Army Fellowship Gospel Victory Meetings. There, I experienced true repentance. God not only revealed the sins I was aware of, but even the hidden ones I had long forgotten. I was filled with overwhelming joy and a new desire: “If I live, I want to live for God.”</p>
<p>Six months later, I fell from a 40-foot tall tree. Remarkably, God had already shown me this incident in a vision three times beforehand.</p>
<p>I was admitted to the hospital, and they told me I would need ₹50,000 for surgery. Instead of staying, I told them I’d return the next day—and went straight to meet the servants of God.</p>
<p>At Holy Army Fellowship, I believed that God would work in me—and by His grace, He healed me completely.</p>
<p>After that, God gave me peace in my heart, and I decided to live for Him. I surrendered myself to God’s service and went to Mandavalli for ministry training.</p>
<p>Now, having completed the training, I am faithfully serving in the region that God appointed me to.</p>
<p>Please pray for me and my service, that my family and I may remain faithful to God and the fellowship until the very end.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is T.simon. I was born into a family that did not know the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We are five siblings, and I am the eldest. My father was addicted to alcohol, cockfighting, and gambling. Because there was no peace in our home, I grew up at my grandfather’s house.</p>
<p>My grandfather had great hopes that I would pursue my education seriously. However, I was very mischievous and lived a careless life. I got involved in stealing, lying, using foul language, watching movies, gambling, and wasted my life in sinful ways.</p>
<p>In my childhood, I once fell from a mango tree and went into a coma. It was only by the grace of God that I survived.</p>
<p>Seeing how I was going astray, my parents tried to help me by putting me in different jobs—such as motor mechanic work—but I failed in all of them. Eventually, they took me to Vizag, where I worked at a sweet shop from 3:00 PM to 9:00 PM. As a result, I developed severe back pain.</p>
<p>The pain worsened due to the earlier fall, and I frequently had to visit hospitals. People would insult me, saying, “If you're like this now, how will you ever get married?”</p>
<p>Because of the pain, I also suffered from fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. In that suffering, I cried out to God—and by the next morning, He healed me. Yet, my life remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Later, due to increasing debts, my father took us to work at a poultry farm near Nuzvid. We all worked there. One day, while my sister was collecting eggs, some trays slipped and broke. When the supervisor reported it to my father, he questioned her. She lied, saying she didn’t know anything—and my father beat her.</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed, my sister said she would end her life and drank pesticide used for the chickens. After being denied admission at several hospitals, an MLA helped us get her into a government hospital. They managed to flush out the poison. She survived for a week but eventually turned yellow and became unresponsive. She was declared dead.</p>
<p>We were told to take her body home. But in that desperate moment, I knelt and cried out to God, “Please bring her back to life!” God heard my prayer—and my sister came back to life.</p>
<p>Later, my parents arranged my marriage to a girl who knew the Lord. We were happy for about six months, but I eventually returned to my old habits—coming home late at night, living carelessly. Although we were initially childless, when some relatives took us to a church and we prayed, God blessed us with children. Still, my life did not change.</p>
<p>At that time, believers from Holy Army Fellowship began visiting our home and sharing the Gospel. I resisted them many times and opposed their message, but they kept coming patiently.</p>
<p>One day, a man in our village—who had once been addicted to alcohol and idol worship—shared his testimony. He had gone to Mandavalli, repented, and was now a transformed man. His mother, who used to watch dramas and plays, was also changed.</p>
<p>He took me to meet the servants of God. One of them, a brother, spoke to me directly. He asked, “Have you lied, cursed, beaten your wife?” Then he challenged me further: “Even animals wouldn’t consume the things you're addicted to.”</p>
<p>At that time, I was addicted to 20 deluxe cigarette packs, chewing tobacco, and other harmful substances.</p>
<p>Through the testimonies I heard, I too began to long for repentance. I went to Mandavalli.</p>
<p>During my time of repentance, I confessed all the sins I could remember from my childhood. Yet I felt that God had not yet spoken to me. The servants of God said, “Perhaps there are sins you have forgotten.”</p>
<p>I cried out to God—and then I remembered how I had once broken my wife's arm and threatened to break the other if she told anyone. I confessed even such hidden and painful sins.</p>
<p>After that, God gave me a vision. I saw a wall, and the bricks were falling off one by one. Then a light shone through the wall and touched me. God gave me multiple visions and filled me with great peace and joy. Through true repentance, He gave me a new life.</p>
<p>God then called me into ministry—but I was afraid. One day, while cutting down a tree, I got electrocuted and was near death. But God saved me.</p>
<p>Because of such powerful experiences, I finally submitted to God’s call. I went to Mandavalli for ministry training.</p>
<p>Now, by God’s grace, I am actively serving the Lord in His ministry.</p>
<p>Please pray for me and my ministry—that I may remain faithful to God and to the Fellowship until the end.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>Beloved in Christ, I am from a village called Kollaparru in West Godavari District. I was born into a family that did not know the Creator, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>I am the fifth child in my family. When I was born, my father took me to Tirupati and named me Venkateswara Rao.</p>
<p>My father loved me very much. He used to take me to movies and cockfights. During the summer, he would give me liquor, saying, “It cools the body.” That’s how I got into the habit of drinking from a young age.</p>
<p>He was well known in our village and often mediated disputes. He used vulgar language. Since I wanted to become a "big man" like him, I also began to use filthy language.</p>
<p>As I grew older, my nature became worse. I began to have impure thoughts about everyone I saw.</p>
<p>During that time, I made friends with two individuals. Together, we wandered to many places and ruined our lives.</p>
<p>Seeing my condition, my father thought marriage might bring stability, so I was married at a young age.</p>
<p>After marriage, I didn’t know how to live with my wife. Not long after, my father passed away.</p>
<p>I continued living a worldly life. Yet in His love, God blessed us with a baby boy. Everyone said we were lucky.</p>
<p>But after just 17 days, our baby passed away. He was a beautiful child. I had even planned to name him after a deity I worshipped. But just two days after thinking that, he died.</p>
<p>Later, God again blessed us with another baby boy—a healthy and chubby child.</p>
<p>We celebrated his first birthday joyfully. Then one day, after committing sin with a woman in the fields, I returned home. As I arrived, my son crawled toward me. I picked him up with those same sinful hands.</p>
<p>Within five minutes, his body turned hot, and his neck became stiff. We rushed him to the hospital in Akiveedu, but by the next morning, he died.</p>
<p>At that time, I did not realize it was because of the sinful hands with which I had picked him up. I understood it only later.</p>
<p>Dear ones, we were broken by these tragedies. Many people came and said things like, “If the tree remains, it will bear fruit someday,” and left.</p>
<p>In the midst of our grief, God's servant Brother Abraham came to our house. He told me, “Your children died because of your sins. Come to Mandavalli and repent. God will bless you with better children.”</p>
<p>Until that point, I had no interest in anything related to Jesus Christ. Even the words of my relatives did not move me. But the words of this servant of God touched my heart.</p>
<p>He said, “If you correct your sins, God will bless you with good children.” Moved by this hope, I went to repent.</p>
<p>There, the servant of God gave me a New Testament Bible and taught me how to confess my sins. I began confessing every sin I had committed since childhood before God.</p>
<p>As I prayed, God revealed even the sins I had forgotten. I confessed and corrected myself.</p>
<p>Then, in a vision, I heard the voice of God saying, “Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.”</p>
<p>God removed the sinful thoughts from my mind. I also saw a vision where He opened a bottle and poured oil over my head. As the oil flowed, the layers of sin over my eyes fell away, and I could see clearly.</p>
<p>From that moment, my heart was filled with joy. God gave me victory over sin.</p>
<p>Later, God's servants asked my wife and me to kneel, and they prayed for us to have blessed children. And truly, God gave us a daughter and a son.</p>
<p>As time passed, God began to speak to me and called me to serve Him. I did not know how to read, but when the servants of God prayed for me, the Lord helped me learn to read the Bible.</p>
<p>I then attended ministry training, completed it, and now I am serving God in the place He has shown me.</p>
<p>God is with us in every situation and is leading us forward.</p>
<p>I humbly ask you all to pray that my family and I may remain faithful to God and to the fellowship until the end.</p>
<p>With this, I conclude my testimony.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Bala Chandra. I was born as the fifth child to my parents, after four elder sisters. Since they had only daughters, my mother underwent sterilization surgery. However, due to a failure in the procedure, I was born five years later.</p>
<p>My father was involved in selling and drinking local liquor, cockfights, and gambling. He passed away when I was just five years old.</p>
<p>At that time, we didn’t even have a proper house, and food was very hard to come by. As I grew up, I started picking up cigarette and beedi stubs to smoke and used to dance for record music to earn money.</p>
<p>Being the only son after four daughters, my mother raised me with a lot of pampering. I studied in our village up to the 5th grade.</p>
<p>For higher studies, I was sent to a hostel in Repalle. But I often lacked basic items like soap, oil, books, and pens. Many times, I suffered from scabies due to poor hygiene.</p>
<p>In that hostel, I came to know about God through the story of the Prodigal Son. Initially, I was drawn to Him through songs, then through Bible quizzes, where I came to know more about God.</p>
<p>I used to win prizes in Bible and song competitions, and people thought I was a good person. But my life hadn’t changed internally.</p>
<p>Later, I was baptized in the 10th grade. During intermediate, as I grew older, my thoughts and eyes wandered, especially towards girls.</p>
<p>For money, I used to do daily labor like masonry work and catering. I would sneak out from the hostel over compound walls to earn some income.</p>
<p>In this way, I completed my Intermediate, Degree, and Post-Graduation in Repalle itself. But I remained a nominal believer.</p>
<p>Later, I joined Narayana College near Guntur for a job. During that time, I started attending Mahima Mandiram church in Guntur.</p>
<p>One day, a servant of God asked me, "Have you truly repented?" He asked this because I was looking at women even while singing worship songs.</p>
<p>I said I had repented, but then he shared his personal testimony, which made me realize what true repentance is.</p>
<p>That day I understood that I only took baptism, but I had not truly repented.</p>
<p>Later, I came to Mandavalli to attend repentance meetings.</p>
<p>The servants of God there asked me to confess all the sins I remembered, and said, “The ones you forget, God Himself will remind you.”</p>
<p>God showed me all my past sins — lying, cheating, stealing, copying in exams — everything I did since childhood.</p>
<p>I confessed every sin with tears and made corrections. In a vision, I saw the words from Mark 2:5 — "Son, your sins are forgiven."</p>
<p>That brought me great joy and peace. I continued working while spending my free time going out for evangelism with God’s servants.</p>
<p>Regarding my marriage, Elder Jacob stood as a father figure to me, since I had no father. He took full responsibility for my wedding, loving me more than even a biological parent would.</p>
<p>Even though I had already received a calling for ministry, I was working along with my wife due to a commitment made to my father-in-law.</p>
<p>Later, God called me again into full-time ministry, so I went to Mandavalli and underwent ministry training.</p>
<p>During the training, Spiritual Mother cared for me like her own son, strengthening me in devotion and teaching me how to serve God.</p>
<p>After the training, God revealed a place to me three times. When I shared it with Spiritual Mother, she confirmed it and sent me there for ministry.</p>
<p>Therefore, I kindly request you to pray for me and my ministry, that I may remain faithful to God and His calling until the end.</p>
<p>My heartfelt greetings to you all.</p>

            <div class="testimony-full">
              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is Prashanth Raju. I am from Jangareddygudem in the West Godavari district.</p>
<p>I was born as the third child in my family, which came from a devout Hindu background. From a young age, I was deeply devoted to Hindu religious practices. I grew up opposing Christians and Christian fellowships. My father’s younger sister and her son were involved in evangelism in Vijayawada.</p>
<p>Whenever they visited our home, I would speak harshly and disrespectfully to them. However, through the Lord Jesus Christ, many good things began to happen in our family — yet we still did not accept Him or like anything related to Him.</p>
<p>There was no peace in our home. Constant quarrels filled our household. In search of peace, we traveled to many places, but found no answers. Due to financial difficulties, our family returned to our native place — Vijayawada. Even there, we still had no peace.</p>
<p>In 2004, I began working as a lorry cleaner. On June 30, 2004, while returning from Hyderabad, the lorry I was in met with a terrible accident near Vijayawada. In that accident, both of my legs and one hand were fractured.</p>
<p>People at the scene looked at me and said, “Where was this boy born? He’s going to die here.” Everyone thought I would not survive.</p>
<p>Soon after, I was placed in an ambulance and taken to a private hospital. Due to severe blood loss, doctors said I had developed heart complications and advised that I be shifted to Hyderabad immediately. However, due to time constraints, I was admitted to Ramesh Hospital nearby.</p>
<p>There, I was kept in the ICU for three days. After that, my heart returned to normal, and I was taken to an orthopedic hospital for further treatment.</p>
<p>By then, my father’s nephew — a pastor — had shared the Gospel with my mother. I remained unconscious until July 7. On that day, doctors took me in for surgery. During this time, many Christians were praying for me. By the grace of God, I underwent seven surgeries.</p>
<p>I spent 45 days in the hospital, enduring a lot of pain. During this time, my pastor cousin would visit and share about the Lord Jesus with me. I used to get angry with him, but he always spoke gently and patiently.</p>
<p>Many Christians visited me, shared the Word of God, and prayed with tears. Slowly, during my hospital stay, I came to know the Lord.</p>
<p>After being discharged and returning home, I began to pray. By God's grace, I recovered quickly and was able to walk again.</p>
<p>Later, I joined a church and became a believer. I was baptized — but there was no real change in my life.</p>
<p>Though I attended church regularly, my words and thoughts remained sinful. Outwardly, I was known as a good believer, but inwardly I was filled with evil thoughts and intentions. That was the state of my empty spiritual life.</p>
<p>One day, when I invited my father to attend church, he said, “First, change your own life.”</p>
<p>Though I looked devout on the outside, I was filled with corrupt and sinful thoughts inside. I had a desire to serve God, but seeing the behavior of some evangelists discouraged me.</p>
<p>Even then, I thought of myself as holy — but my thoughts were terribly impure.</p>
<p>One day, while working in an office, some evangelists from the Holy Army Fellowship in Mandavalli visited Vijayawada and asked me, “Brother, have you truly repented?”</p>
<p>I didn’t understand what repentance really meant. I thought baptism itself was repentance.</p>
<p>They then asked, “Brother, will you go to Heaven?” I replied, “Yes.” Then they asked, “Do you have victory over your thoughts?” I said, “No.” “Do you have victory over money?” I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>Then they asked again, “Will you go to Heaven now?” I answered, “No.”</p>
<p>They replied, “Then you must repent and confess your sins before the Lord — only then will He speak to you.”</p>
<p>As the evangelists shared their testimonies with me, I began to long for true repentance.</p>
<p>On March 28, 2008, I went to Mandavalli to repent. The evangelists there told me, “Confess your sins before God. Then He will speak to you.”</p>
<p>For the next three days, I confessed all the small sins I could remember. I thought I hadn’t done anything major. But after three days, God still hadn’t spoken to me.</p>
<p>I told the evangelists, “I confessed my sins, but God hasn’t spoken to me.” They said, “You’ve only confessed what you remember. Now ask God to show you what you’ve forgotten.”</p>
<p>They said, “Then He will speak.”</p>
<p>So I sat in prayer and asked God — and He began to reveal every hidden sin: the thefts I committed as a child, the people I hurt in school, the movies I watched in my youth, my impure thoughts, and those I had wounded emotionally. As God revealed these, I was terrified.</p>
<p>During one prayer, as I confessed every sin, I felt as though a great demon inside me was being cast out. God showed me this.</p>
<p>After that prayer, when I stepped outside, I felt overwhelming peace and joy. The evangelists said, “You have truly repented.” My heart was filled with joy like never before.</p>
<p>As I continued to pray, God gave me many visions and revealed His will — that I should serve Him.</p>
<p>I remained at Mandavalli and joined the evangelism ministry. After a few days, I returned home to Vijayawada and asked my parents for forgiveness. I also sought forgiveness from all my family members.</p>
<p>Then I returned to Mandavalli. While serving there, God continued to strengthen me. The spiritual family supported me greatly.</p>
<p>In 2012, the evangelists arranged my marriage. In 2016, they sent me to the Gudivada area for ministry.</p>
<p>In my journey of ministry, God has strengthened me in many ways. He has given me victory in several areas of life and is using me for His glory.</p>
<p>To this day, I have undergone 14 surgeries. Kindly uphold me in your prayers, that I may continue to remain faithful to God.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>

              <p>Beloved in Lord,</p>
<p>My name is John Babu, and I come from Vaasala Thippa, a village near Amalapuram. We are three brothers in our family, and I am the second son. From my childhood, my mother believed in the Lord and regularly attended the presence of God.</p>
<p>However, despite her faith, our family lacked peace, healing, and resolution. During that time, a relative named Swathi introduced us to the Holy Army Fellowship. Through that connection, my mother experienced true repentance and was delivered from her troubles. Later, to my surprise, even my father began attending church.</p>
<p>Soon, they encouraged me to come into the presence of God and repent. But I casually replied, "I’ll change when I’m your age." Eventually, I completed my degree and secured a job at TCS in Chennai.</p>
<p>Being far away from my parents, I began to drift spiritually and fell into deeper sin. Over time, I developed ulcers and felt physically weak. I consulted many hospitals, but no treatment worked. Eventually, I got permission to travel back home. During the journey, I met a man who claimed he could help me get a job in our state. Trusting him, I borrowed and gave him ₹2,20,000, only to later find out I had been cheated.</p>
<p>Heartbroken and hopeless, I didn’t even have the courage to die. I lived in a state of confusion and despair for several days. In that broken state, someone took me to a repentance gathering. There, the servants of God told me to confess every sin I had committed since childhood.</p>
<p>I began to fast and confess my sins, but for the first three days, I couldn’t understand anything. I even began to feel angry at the servants of God who were trying to help me. But during a time of prayer, the Holy Spirit touched me, and I experienced true repentance. I became aware of the wickedness in my heart and began confessing everything — my drinking, smoking, sinful activities through my mobile, and much more.</p>
<p>One night, I heard the Lord say to me, "Wake up and pray." As I obeyed and prayed, the Lord filled my heart with a joy I had never known before. With that joy, I returned home, reconciled with my family, asked forgiveness from those I had wronged, and returned everything I had stolen.</p>
<p>Since then, I have been dwelling in the presence of God, traveling with His servants, and learning deep spiritual truths. In God's perfect timing, I got married, and as a couple, we came to the Mandavalli Training Center. Our spiritual mother there taught us many truths and strengthened us in the faith.</p>
<p>Later, God spoke to me five times about going to a specific region for ministry. Following His leading, and with the blessing of our spiritual mother, we were sent to Tirupati to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>From the day I encountered this fellowship until now, God has done many miracles in my life. He healed me from ulcers and physical weakness. He freed me from debt. He delivered me from sin. He brought peace and unity into our family and made us a living testimony.</p>
<p>Now, all three of us brothers are serving the Lord, and God has graciously given us the privilege of ministry. Please pray that we remain faithful in God’s service until the very end.</p>
<p>Greetings to all.</p>
<p>Yours Brother in Christ’s service,</p>
<p>D. John Babu</p>
