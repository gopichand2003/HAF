                  <p>Kolleti Lake is a tranquil body of water, and on its shores lies the village of Ingilipakalanka. In this village lived a couple, Mudraboina Venkateswara Rao and Ravulamma. They had two sons and two daughters and were a humble family. In those days, due to a lack of medical facilities, cholera outbreaks were common, leaving many children orphaned. Despite their struggles, the couple lovingly raised the children who had lost their parents, ensuring they never felt the pain of growing up without parents.</p>

                  <p>I was born as the youngest son in this family. According to their tradition, I was named Veerabrahman at birth. Even in childhood, I displayed remarkable wisdom. I often used my intelligence to escape from studies. Surprisingly, the words I spoke in my childhood often came true. Though my parents were devoted idol worshippers, my heart never resonated with idolatry. Yet, out of tradition, I participated in their practices.</p>

                  <p>Life in Kolleti was difficult. Farming was challenging due to unpredictable water levels. During the rice-sweeping season, there would be no water, but during harvest, floods would submerge the entire Kolleru region. Amid these hardships, my mother fell seriously ill. Despite visiting numerous hospitals and spending a fortune on treatments, her condition only worsened. My parents faithfully worshipped their gods, hoping for a miracle, but to no avail. As time passed, her illness became more severe. One day, a passerby told my mother, &quot;If you put your faith in the Lord, your disease will be healed.&quot; Desperate for relief, she accepted the Lord as her Savior. Through this faith, she found peace and transformation. Our home became a place of fellowship and hope. The evangelists were invited to pray through fasting. They preached the Word of God, and my family sent them away with joy. My mother suffered from this illness for twelve long years, but her faith in the Lord remained steadfast.</p>

                  <p>I was a student living in a hostel, far from home. The thought of my mother often brought me to tears, and a deep sadness always flowed within me. One night, after crying myself to sleep over thoughts of her, I had a dream. In this dream, my mother had passed away. She was placed in a coffin according to Christian customs, and as they carried her to the grave, I ran after them, screaming and crying.From the coffin being carried, she sat up and said, &#x27;My child, do not weep. The Lord has called me, and so I must go. He will be with you, so be strong and do not grieve.&quot; I woke up in a panic, drenched in sweat and tears. That very night, I rushed home, covering six kilometers to reach my mother. I told her about the dream, and we both wept together until morning. The next day, I returned to the hostel.</p>

                  <p>A few days later, as I was climbing the stairs to my classroom, a wave of overwhelming sadness hit me. My books slipped from my hands, and I broke down in tears. Tearfully, I asked the children from my village how my mother was doing. They replied, Everyone from the village is gathered near your house. In my heart, I felt that the reason for my sorrow was the thought that something was wrong with my mother. During the first period, my teacher noticed my distress and sent a friend to where I was standing outside. As we both hurried toward our village, I realized that my mother’s brother, Bungayya, was coming toward me. Tears streaming down his face, he asked, &#x27;Are you coming with me?&#x27; He took a few steps forward, then turned back and walked away, and In that moment, I realized something had happened to my mother. By then, they had laid my mother to rest, her life gone. Everyone around wept bitterly. Witnessing that sight, my heart shattered into fragments.Unable to hold back my grief, I collapsed and wept uncontrollably. Her eyes opened briefly, tears streaming down her cheeks, and she took one last look at me before closing them forever. The entire village wept with me, knowing that a mother&#x27;s love is eternal, even in death. Her funeral was conducted according to Christian rites, and as soon as it ended,a fierce rainstorm and tempest began. I sobbed uncountablly, fearing that even in death, my mother would be caught in the strom but everyone eventually left, and I was left alone in my grief.</p>

                  <p>The loss of my mother’s love left a storm of pain within me, tearing my small world apart. Hatred and bitterness were all that remained in my life. In a whisper no one could hear, I cursed Jesus, denying His divinity. Ten days later, I returned to the hostel, still drowning in sorrow. My friends, upon hearing about my mother’s death, tried to comfort me. Everyone showed me kindness, but I was inconsolable. I often recalled the words my mother had spoken in my dream and thought about how much she had loved me. Nights were the hardest; I would cry alone, unable to sleep, consumed by grief.</p>

                  <p>My friends, who were not the best influence, began taking me to the fields instead of school, teaching me to smoke cigarettes. At night, they took me to the movies. Conflicts were a frequent occurrence in the hostel. Whenever someone got hurt, their parents would come to comfort them. But I had no one. No matter how much I am hurt, how much I bleed, or even if I have a fever, there is no one for me to confide in. There’s no mother here—whom do I call ‘Mother’? If my mother were alive, she would have cherished me too. In the quiet of the night, I would sneak into the alley nearby and weep until late, longing for her warmth and the comfort of her embrace.  . Losing the one person I loved most—my mother—left me empty. Love faded from my heart, replaced by anger, hatred, envy, and a desire for revenge.</p>

                  <p>When it came to standing against injustice, I was someone who wouldn’t even hesitate to risk my life. If someone made a girl cry, my friends and I would confront them. I never hesitated to get involved, even in matters that were not my own. Hundreds of friends stood by me to do good, yet even when I was alone, I fearlessly faced bullies and wrongdoers—without realizing that, in the eyes of our righteous God, such actions were like filthy rags.Academically, I was careless. I rarely attended classes and had a reputation as a troublemaker in college. Watching six movies a day became my routine and then return to my room . I would leave my room early in the morning for a 7 AM show, followed by 11 AM, matinee, first, second, and even midnight screenings. Sundays were spent at the beach with friends. After two years, I returned to my hometown and became involved in village politics. I started gathering people on my side, stepping into a different kind of influence.</p>

                  <p>A cruel troublemaker had been tormenting women who ventured outside the village, treating them with extreme brutality. No one had the courage or strength to confront him, and the villagers, crushed by his cruelty, came to me seeking help. They shared their pain and requested me to teach him a lesson. They dressed me in women&#x27;s clothing and sent me outside the village after sunset, while they watched from a distance. As I stood alone, the troublemaker approached and grabbed my hand. At that moment, every fiber of my being filled with rage, and with all my strength, I struck him down. He collapsed to the ground, writhing in pain and fear, before scrambling to his feet and fleeing into the village, where he fell unconscious. I removed my disguise, changed back into my clothes, and approached him. Trembling, he begged, &#x27;Why are you here? Leave me alone,&#x27; and told me to go away.</p>

                  <p>Once, when I came home for summer vacation, I found the house empty, with no one around. Stricken by a gust of wind and faint with hunger, I lie upon the bed. With no one to care for me or provide food, I fall asleep overwhelmed by despair. Around 2 PM, my father came home, saw my condition, and, with a heavy heart, cooked food and handed me. While my mother was alive, my relatives were somewhat supportive. However, after her passing, I was left without any care or support, to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even cook for myself. Overcome with sorrow, I left the village in tears and reached my elder sister&#x27;s house in Tenali Patnam. My sister and brother-in-law cared for me more than they did for her own children. After the holidays, when returning to my village, I would stand at the train door, tears streaming down my face, remembering my sister as I reached home. Due to our family&#x27;s situation, there was no one to cook at home, so they arranged my elder brother&#x27;s marriage. No matter how short-tempered, mischievous, or arrogant I was—no matter how many quarrels I caused in the village—my sister-in-law cared for me more than her own children, raising me like my own mother.</p>

                  <p>I am someone who, along with my companions, fearlessly steps forward to confront any number of people, regardless of whether they are strangers or kin, in order to fight against injustice and uphold justice. Many times, I risked my life to oppose the corruption, bribery, and wrongful actions that turned justice into injustice in our village. In such situations, a few like-minded individuals, who could not tolerate the growing injustice, greed, and corruption, joined me. Together, we vowed to stand against these wrongdoers and establish true justice in our region.A wealthy merchant who knew us well provided two rifles and several bullets, storing them securely in his house. He encouraged us, saying, &quot;If you want the land to be safe, you must punish these corrupt people without fail.&quot; He made us swear an oath and gave us instructions on how to use the weapons. He warned us, &quot;Do not hesitate. Do not count your lives. Fight without fear.&quot;At that time, I was just 19 years old, while the others were older than me.</p>

                  <p>During those days, prayer gatherings were being organized in our village. The village pastor and community leaders came to invite me and spoke to me, saying:&quot;Babu, your mother had great faith in the Lord Jesus. She worshiped Him wholeheartedly and has now entered the kingdom of God. We would love for you to attend these gatherings, listen to God&#x27;s word, and receive His blessings. If you tell us that you will come, we will leave assured.&quot;I told them, &quot;Yes, I will come.&quot;However, in my heart, I had no real intention of attending. After hearing my words, they left.</p>

                  <p>The prayer gatherings began. The next morning, he came again and asked, “Babu, you said you would come to the meeting today. Are you coming?”I couldn’t go back on my word, so I went. The evangelist were preaching, sharing divine wisdom. “Brother, be careful. &quot;If you are planning to do something to someone, God is going to do something to you.&quot;He pointed directly at me as he spoke.Hearing his words, I became very angry. &quot;Are they insulting me like this just to make me attend the gatherings? I wanted to see their end.&quot;But as he continued speaking , the evangelist pointed at me and said, “If you obey God, He will make you greater than me.” In my heart, I thought, &#x27;He doesn’t even know about my bad habits. I have tried many times to quit smoking, but I couldn’t. I used to crush the cigarette pack and throw it away, only to buy another one and smoke again .Because of the Jaraada Killis, even though my cheeks have been slapped repeatedly, I cannot stop it. In my heart, I am thinking that what He says is a complete lie. On a sudden, then he said, “What I am telling you is true. Believe my words—God will transform you this very day.&#x27; As he preached these words, they deeply touched my heart, and I liked them very much.&quot;He also assured, “God will speak to you.”After the gathering ended, I started walking away but suddenly stopped and turned back to look at the evangelist. I wondered, &#x27;If I share everything about my life with him, maybe he will show me a way to change before my life is completely ruined.&#x27; Thinking this, I looked toward him. But I hesitated—there were so many people around him.&quot;They are all devotees,&quot; I thought, &quot;and I am not like them. I don&#x27;t belong here.&quot;Just as I was about to walk away, he suddenly called out, “Hey, brother, come here!I turned around, unsure if he was talking to me. I looked around to see if he meant someone else. But he looked directly at me and said again, “Yes, you—come here.”So, I went to him. Everyone is offering their praises to Him. I used to consider bowing with both hands as a shame, but since everyone was doing it, I also saluted with both hands. He then spoke to me and asked, &quot;Will you come to Nujividu and have a repentance?&quot; I replied, &quot;I will come and change my heart.&quot; Then he said, &quot;Why do you come? You will slip away like Channa punctata fish.&quot; I felt deeply insulted and thought, &quot;How can he speak to me like this?&quot; Filled with anger, I went home.</p>

                  <p>According to the agreement I had made, my group members came to call me, but my elder brother saw them and, feeling displeased, told them to leave, so they left. That night, I could not sleep, as the words spoken by the evangelist echoed in my ears repeatedly, as if they were greeting me over and over again in my mind, their voices playing in my head, making me restless. Finally, I decided: &quot;No matter what, I must go and repent before God.&quot; As planned, I woke up early in the morning and set out on my journey, just then, my father arrived from Tenali and asked, &quot;Where have you traveled to?&quot; I replied, &quot;I am going because the evangelist has asked me to come and repent. Maybe I will change.&quot; Hearing this, my father responded, &quot;Instead of talking crazy, remember that you have dug a seven-acre pond and spent seventy thousand rupees, saying you will take care of it. So, you cannot go anywhere.&quot; I firmly replied, &quot;If I don’t go, neither you, I, nor our property will remain. Be careful! Maybe I will change.&quot; Immediately, my father gave me money and sent me away. On the second day, I arrived and was admitted to ITI, and soon after, I began fasting and praying for my transformation, confessing every sin before God, hoping for a divine encounter, but God did not speak to me, and I did not experience any transformation. I started thinking: &quot;This is all just deception. They are fooling people.&quot; With this in my mind, I went to God&#x27;s people and said, &quot;God did not speak to me.&quot; The evangelist responded, &quot;Now you are on the right way.&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;They don’t know I’ve already packed my suitcase to leave.&quot; Then he told me, &quot;You have confessed the sins you remember, but there are many sins you have forgotten. Ask the Lord to remind you, and He will bring them to your memory.&quot;</p>

                  <p>I began praying again. As I was deep in prayer, I heard a loud noise, like a train passing over me. As this kept happening repeatedly, I was unable to move forward in prayer. Confused, I asked the evangelist why this was happening. Then he asked, &quot;Have you ever traveled on a train without a ticket?&quot; I was shocked by the question. In fact, I had once traveled from Ponnur to Tenali without a ticket. I immediately admitted it. He then instructed me, &quot;Buy a ticket and tear it up as a sign of repentance.&quot;I obeyed and then returned to prayer. Suddenly, like a movie reel, my sins started playing before my eyes. I recalled how, during college, I used to eat for more days but write for fewer. The Lord was showing me everything so clearly that I began to cry. I confessed, &quot;Lord, I am truly a thief.&quot; As God revealed every sin before my eyes, I realized that I had been justifying my actions according to the world. But in that moment, He gave me the understanding that everything I had done was unjust in His sight. Even though I was someone who never spoke inappropriately to girls, my thoughts and glances were impure. When God revealed this hidden truth, I began to weep even more.The Spirit of the Lord began to work mightily upon me. Without realizing it, I started crying loudly. I confessed and corrected all my sins. I made amends—some in person, some through money orders, and some through letters. In this way, my heart was cleansed. I even bought a train ticket and tore it to atone for traveling without one. From then on, I made it a habit to ask God for forgiveness for every sin, and He blessed me by helping me set things right.</p>

                  <p>Gradually, the joy of salvation filled my heart. Everything around me—every tree, every person—seemed new, as if I were seeing them for the first time. Even the smallest things in creation looked fresh and beautiful. My heart felt so light that, without realizing it, I began to leap with joy. I had never experienced such happiness in my life before. Whenever I saw someone, I would speak to them with tears in my eyes, warning them about their spiritual downfall. I would passionately explain their condition and share in detail how I had received the blessing of the Lord&#x27;s salvation. Upon hearing my words, many began to weep, and in this way, the Lord was graciously using me to bring many to Him. I started spending hours in the Lord&#x27;s presence—reading multiple chapters of the Bible and devoting quality time to prayer. This became a deep part of my life. Through this journey, I drew closer to the Lord and fully embraced the joy of salvation. The Lord spoke to me many times through visions and His Word, guiding me in even the smallest matters of life. He began to reveal His plans for me with great clarity.</p>

                  <p>One time, I lost my hotel ticket book. Since there was no name on it, anyone who found it could use it to eat. The second morning, I was deeply troubled. As I walked, I thought to myself, &quot;Lord, I am very hungry. I have no patience to go to the hotel without my ticket book. Please provide me with food right now.” At that moment, evangelist approached me from behind, took my hand, and said, &quot;Today is my daughter&#x27;s birthday; you must eat with us.&quot; They took me to the gathering and prepared food for me along with everyone else. I praised the Lord for His provision.</p>

                  <p>That evening, as the sun was setting, I prayed with tears, &quot;Lord, was there any disobedience in me that caused my ticket book to disappear? Please reveal it to me.&quot; Immediately, I felt the Lord speak to me: &quot;Go for lunch, and I will return your tickets at the hotel.&quot; I got up and shared this with those around me. They were surprised but followed me to the hotel. After washing my hands, I sat down to eat. After finishing the meal, I washed my hands, wiped them, and stood in front of the hotel proprietor. Those who came with me stood aside, curiously watching what would happen. Time passed, yet I remained standing, believing that the Lord would fulfill His promise. Immediately, a doubt arose in my mind, and I looked at the phone next to me. &quot;If they pressure me for payment, I will call to evangelist for help,&quot; I thought. Just as the proprietor was about to ask for money, I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could speak, a man came running from inside. Proprietor and I were watching him . He approached me and asked, &quot;Is this ticket book yours?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s mine,&quot; and took it, the people with me excitedly ran around the hotel, rejoicing.When the proprietor asked, &quot;What happened?&quot; we explained the situation. We rejoiced and returned happily. At that moment, I marveled at the faithfulness of God. He had not only provided my meal but also returned what was lost, just as He had promised.</p>

                  <p>One day, the evangelist called me and another brother, instructing us to pray over a buffalo that had been bitten by a venomous snake. We went as requested. The buffalo had collapsed, with red blood streaming from its nose. It was gasping and struggling for breath. In faith, I anointed it with coconut oil and prayed, saying, “Lord, let this buffalo rise now and regain its strength.” Immediately, the buffalo stood up and began panting. Witnessing this, everyone present was astonished and praised God. Through moments like these, the Lord continually strengthened my faith. Observing my way of life, some parents entrusted their children to stay with me, believing that their children would be positively influenced in my presence. Many among them experienced repentance, encountered the Lord, and, by His grace, witnessed great works in that place.</p>

                  <p>One day, as I was deep in prayer, my eyes were closed, but my heart was open. In that moment, I became unaware of myself, and the Lord stood before me and spoke. I often found myself conversing with Him about many things. To the Lord’s left, I saw a man dressed in flowing robes, with a turban and a beard. He pulled a Bible from a bag slung over his shoulder and began preaching. Lord, why is he speaking the spiritual word to himself without anyone around? I laughed. Immediately, the Lord turned to me and said, Go to that person now. When He instructed me, I replied, Yes, Lord,and began to walk from the Lord’s presence toward that man.</p>

                  <p>However, reaching him was not easy—thousands of people surrounded him, eagerly listening to the Word. Until that moment, I was unaware of what was unfolding. As I stood there, I wondered, &quot;Where did such a large crowd come from when there was no one near him?&quot; Intrigued, I made my way into the gathering, pushing through the people with great effort until I reached him.He was preaching the Word, and the people listened intently, captivated by his presence. There was a divine radiance on his face—a glow that seemed almost otherworldly. His humble yet striking appearance reminded me of a white guava, pure and luminous. I have never seen such a beautiful man in my entire life! I thought to myself. Look at him—how beautiful he is! Is there anyone else like him?. I stood there in awe, thinking, &#x27;If I were to place my fingers on his face, the marks of my fingers would remain on him.&#x27; Lost in this thought, I kept looking at him and the crowd.  At that moment, my thoughts turned to the Lord. Oh no, I left the Lord under the tree! I thought, and with urgency, I pushed my way out of the gathering to return to Him. When I reached the Lord, I immediately exclaimed, “Lord, he is so beautiful!” The Lord looked at me and gently asked, “Do you know who he is?”I replied, “No, Lord, I do not.” Then the Lord said, &#x27;He is none other than Sadhu Sundar Singh. A sense of awe filled me. “Oh Lord, so that is who he is!” I responded. Then the Lord spoke to me and said, “Abraham, I am going to make you a revivalist like him.” With those words, the vision came to an end. I awoke immediately and went to the evangelist’s mother to share everything I had seen. After listening, she looked at me and said, “The Lord is calling you to serve Him.”</p>

                  <p>And so, as I surrendered myself to God’s service, I felt His presence guiding me. Even in the moonlit night, the dewdrops shimmered. Then, while speaking with the children in the garden, I said with great conviction, If we submit to God, all of creation will submit to us. With deep spiritual intensity, I continued, If I command the rain to fall, it will fall. If I command it to stop, it will cease. Immediately, the children eagerly asked me to make it rain. Without hesitation, I spoke the word, and soon, raindrops began to fall from the sky. The children were astonished. Then, I said, &quot;Rain, stop!&quot; and the downpour ceased. The children erupted in joy, praising God for the miraculous event.</p>

                  <p>On another night, as I was preaching to the children, the sound of chicks crowing began to disrupt our gathering. Their loud cries became a distraction. Instantly, I spoke the word, &quot;Be silent!&quot; and immediately, the flock of chicks fell silent. The children were amazed. My brother, intrigued by what had happened, asked me to command them again. So, I said, &quot;Cry out!&quot; and at once, the chicks began crowing again. The children repeatedly tested this, each time marveling at the response. Through such works, my joy in the Lord grew deeper, and my faith was strengthened.</p>

                  <p>One day, I traveled to my village. The evangelist asked me to return by evening, and I had agreed. However, when I met my father, he insisted that I should not leave yet. Nevertheless, I decided to leave, and as I was returning home from the fields, heavy rain suddenly began to pour. My father said, &quot;How can you travel in such rain?&quot; But the commitment I had made to the evangelist burned in my heart. Without hesitation, I declared, &quot;Rain, stop!&quot; and immediately, the downpour ceased. My faith in God remained unwavering. On another occasion, when I visited my hometown, As I stepped into our house, I called my elder brother’s second daughter to come to me. Lifting her up, I rebuked the darkness in the name of Jesus, saying, &quot;Darkness, leave!&quot; Instantly, she stopped trembling and crying, and instead, she began to smile and play joyfully. Seeing that, my elder brother and sister-in-law were astonished and said, The child has been suffering for four days. We were planning to take her to the hospital. They praised God for the great work He had done. Thus, the Lord began performing many miracles in my life.</p>

                  <p>An elderly woman in the church appeared very weak and seemed to be on the verge of death due to sorrow. I approached her and asked, &quot;Grandmother, which village are you from? Why are you in such a state?. She replied to me, Son, it has been a week since I came here. No one has cared for me and  she shared her story. She had been diagnosed with cancer, and doctors in an American hospital had told that I would die within a month. That was why she had come to this place, she said, while weeping. Hearing her words, my heart was moved with compassion. I prayed for her and assured her that she would recover.That night, while she was praying, she suddenly cried out loudly and said, &quot;Son, I saw a spirit, like a shadow of a sneeze, rise from within me and leave!&quot;. Everyone present with me was afraid. I prayed for her again. The next morning, she woke up and declared, &quot;I am healed!&quot;</p>

                  <p>One day, I received a call from Tenali informing me that my sister and her daughter were unwell, and they asked me to come immediately. I shared the matter with the evangelist and left for Tenali. By the time I arrived, dawn had broken, and they were preparing to take them to the hospital due to a high fever. When I saw my sister and her daughter, I discerned a large evil spirit in one and a smaller spirit in the other. As I prayed over them, I realized that this was not a mere illness but an affliction caused by these spirits. As I continued praying with authority, I saw both spirits leave them. Immediately, the fever subsided. We prayed in the presence of the Lord. That night, my sister confessed every sin to Him.</p>

                  <p>One day, I sought forgiveness from a friend for a mistake I had made. While talking to him, I sensed that he was involved in many wrong doings. I told him, &quot;Brother, it is not good to continue in evil deeds. If you believe in the Lord, it will be good for you.&quot; But he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in Him. If you do, that&#x27;s your choice.” Hearing his words, I was moved to tears and said, &quot;You are speaking in this way because you do not realize the danger ahead of you.&quot; However, he stubbornly dismissed my words and left in frustration. Ten days later, I returned to my village and immediately enquired about him, as he was my close friend. When I asked, someone said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know what happened?&quot; My heart sank, sensing something terrible. Then they told me, &quot;He died in an accident involving a fish lorry near Ichapuram on his way to Calcutta. His body was so badly dismembered that it had to be brought back in a sack.&quot; I was speechless. Grief filled my heart as I realized that he had faced this tragic end because he ignored the Word of God.</p>

                  <p>One day, while I was praying alone, God instructed me, &quot;Abraham, go outside the village.&quot; Obediently, I went. There, I saw God’s angels dwelling in a small compound—it was a Bible seminary college. While speaking with the Bible students, they casually mentioned, &quot;We smoke cigarettes and watch movies.&quot; Hearing this, I shared my testimony with them. After listening, they were amazed and deeply moved. Teenagers learned many things from me and were surprised, saying, &quot;No one has ever taught us such devotion.&quot; They pledged to learn more and remain steadfast in their faith. In this way, God performed many works and strengthened me for His purpose.</p>

                  <p>On one occasion, a farmer sought prayer support for his orchard, which had been afflicted by a pest. In response, a prayer group traveled to his orchard, which was located in a forested area. I was also among them. The fellow evangelists were calling out names one by one, inviting people to pray. Everyone prayed, but I was not given the opportunity to do so. However, I did not feel any distress or anger toward my fellow evangelists. Instead, I believed that God Himself had not given me the opportunity to pray. As we were returning to the village through the forest path, I paused in solitude and began to pray. I prayed to God, asking Him to strengthen me through two instances that would confirm His presence with me on that day. Filled with sorrow, I entered a nearby church. There, the Lord spoke to me through His Word: &quot;For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ&#x27;s, then you are Abraham&#x27;s offspring, heirs according to promise.” (Galatians 3:26-29)This gave me a measure of comfort. Yet, I continued seeking a tangible confirmation of the Lord’s presence with me.Meanwhile, my fellow evangelists at that place sent another brother to accompany me to the center. As we walked, he was speaking to me about God. At one point, that brother turned to me and said, “Brother, these words are not yours; it is God within you who is speaking.” The moment he uttered those words, my spirit was suddenly lifted into the sky.I saw my physical body walking alongside that brother on the road, while my spirit was in the sky, looking down. I could see the streetlights illuminating the market below. I could see my body continuing to walk with him along that street, while I was moving through the sky. After traveling some distance, my spirit re-entered my body. This experience filled me with immense comfort and joy.</p>

                  <p>In my vision, I was standing at the Machilipatnam railway station. The Lord was also there, looking at me, and I was gazing intently at His face. From His face, I could hear the words, &quot;Will you come to Madras?&quot; However, His lips did not move. I was astonished and replied, &quot;There are a few things I need to set right; I will come in a year.&quot; The Lord looked at me, smiled, and left. Exactly after a year, fellow pastors from Madras came. One of them spoke to me and said, &quot;There is no one like you in Madras, brother. Will you come to Madras?&quot; Since the Lord’s words from a year ago were still deeply imprinted in my heart, I rejoiced upon hearing this. I responded, &quot;I have no objection, but ask the evangelist here.&quot; The fellow pastors then sent me with the evangelist from Madras. In Madras, God performed mighty works. One evangelist, who had been married for twelve years but had no children, heard my testimony and requested me to pray for him so that he might receive the blessing of children. In the name of Jesus, I prayed, declaring that they would be blessed with children. Some time later, as I was preparing to return from Madras, that brother came to me, stopped me, and said, &quot;You prayed for us, and now God has opened my wife&#x27;s womb. Here she is, my wife.&quot; He insisted that I visit their home and accept their hospitality. Since they insisted earnestly, I could not refuse, so I went and had a light meal with them. In Madras, I was taken among the Telugu-speaking people to preach the Gospel. The Spirit of God moved powerfully, and a cruel murderer was transformed. He wept bitterly, repented, and confessed his sins, leaving the people in great amazement.</p>

                  <p>It was my habit to spend several hours alone in prayer every night. One night, on a new moon day, I was praying in the midst of deep darkness. The night had passed significantly, and I continued praying alone. Suddenly, from the sky, a dark force weighing nearly 200 kg (about 2 quintals) leaped beside me! The ground shook with a thunderous sound. Startled, I cried out loudly, &quot;Lord!&quot; My voice echoed back. At that moment, the divine light of God surrounded me, forming a circle around me. I hesitated to step beyond that light into the darkness. So, I kept my eyes open and continued praying within that heavenly radiance. God filled me with great courage. In that glorious light, I continued reading the Bible. The presence of the Lord became a profoundly sweet and overwhelming experience for me. From that day onward, I never feared praying in darkness or being alone, because I knew that the Lord was always with me.</p>

                  <p>When devout believers confessed their struggles regarding their thoughts and sought my guidance on how to restore themselves, I would often become angry and rebuke them harshly, saying, &quot;You are unfit for devotion!&quot; I lacked the understanding that the victorious life, holiness, divine encounters, faith, and righteousness I had received were purely by God&#x27;s grace. Instead, I believed that I had attained them through my own devotion. As a result, I was unwilling to help those who had strayed from their faith or to guide them back on the right path. Many feared my strict approach. One day, the Lord spoke to me regarding my flaw: &quot;You are punishing those whom I love.&quot; After hearing this, I shed a few tears and prayed. However, I was unable to persist in prayer until I received God’s forgiveness. Because of this, my devotion weakened, and I was overwhelmed with tears, sorrow, and distress. Yet, God firmly held onto me once again. The Lord taught me the depth of spiritual restoration—how a heart that forgives others can heal even those who have committed great sins.</p>

                  <p>The Lord spoke to me through Psalm 45. Twice, I saw a vision of Psalm 45 written in the sky. The third time, I heard a voice telling me to take the scripture and read it for myself. When I prayed about my marriage, I found my future wife&#x27;s name in that scripture. This confirmation led me to accept the marriage proposal. Before passing away, my mother also spoke about my future. She called Sharammagaru and asked her to give her younger daughter in marriage to me when I came of age. Later, my mother told them, &quot;I am leaving now, but you must ensure that these matters are fulfilled.&quot; After saying this, she rested in the Lord. My elder brother was then married to Nirmalakumari, the daughter of Aashirvadamma, whom my mother regarded as a mother.</p>

                  <p>During those days, caste-based discrimination was deeply ingrained in society. However, since the Lord had spoken to me, I accepted the marriage proposal. Because my mother had discussed it with them earlier, they also joyfully agreed to the inter-caste marriage and approached me. But their relatives and community elders strongly opposed it and tried to prevent the wedding. My father, being a political leader, had thousands of people supporting him. Political leaders and government officials stood by my father’s side. Ultimately, it was God, His word, His promises, my mother’s prayers, and her final words that led to the successful completion of our marriage. Caste barriers were broken. After my marriage, many others followed and entered inter-caste marriages. Even though my marriage was conducted in this way, my heart was deeply wounded. I realized that I, too, had suffered spiritually because I had failed to restore those who had fallen in their faith. Acknowledging this, I fasted and prayed to regain my former victorious spiritual life. The Lord gave me a promise:&quot;I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and a witness of what you have seen of Me and what I will show you. Get up and stand on your feet! I will protect you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, and receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.&quot; (Acts 26:18)</p>

                  <p>One day, early in the morning, the Lord spoke to me: &quot;Were you saved for this? Get up and leave this place.&quot; Immediately, my wife, my two-year-old daughter, my infant son, and I set out for ministry. Since my father and brother were unaware of our departure, they wept upon hearing the news. My mother-in-law, believing that we were leaving according to the Lord’s command, said, &quot;Go as the Lord has told you.&quot; As soon as the Lord spoke, we began our journey. We reached the place where God had led us and spent three months in fasting and prayer. The Lord has preserved me, ensuring that no impurity touches my hands to this day. After the three months of fasting and prayer, the Lord instructed me to go to Mandavalli. That very morning, without delay, I set out as per the Lord’s command. Even though there was not a single believer in that place, I built a house of prayer. God, in His divine ways, led us in faith as never before. He granted us extraordinary divine encounters and began using us in His service. The Lord appeared to me, spoke to me, and inspired me to write down some of these experiences. The Lord, in His grace, was preparing a way for greater spiritual growth in Christ, ensuring the well-being of many souls.</p>

                  <p>It was evening, and I was near the ponds. We had several fish ponds. I felt a desire to eat black fish, so I prayed, &quot;Lord, please give me a small black fish.&quot; However, the fish we raised in our ponds were only white fish—mainly Bochi and Sheelavathi varieties. Then, the Lord spoke to me: &quot;Go to the pond embankment, and I will give you a fish.&quot; At dusk, when there was still a little light, I went to the pond. As I looked into the water, I saw a very large Korameenu fish floating on the surface!. I quickly ran home, brought a stick, and returned to strike the fish. Then, I stepped into the pond to search for it.At that moment, the Lord spoke to me: &quot;Moses was told to speak to the rock, but instead, he struck it!&quot; (Numbers 20:11).Hearing these words, my heart was deeply moved. With tears in my eyes, I stepped back onto the bank. To my amazement, the large fish was already lying near the shore! .I picked it up and took it home. We had never found such a large Korameenu fish even in our Kolleru Lake. My entire family enjoyed the meal, and later, at 8:30 PM, some of our relatives arrived. Even for them, the fish was more than enough. In this way, the Lord performed a wonderful miracle!.</p>

He mockingly questioned, &quot;Would there be any people in the forest?&quot; Then he added, &quot;I will come with you and see if what God told you is true.&quot; He followed me, and together we wandered through the entire forest, but we saw no one. He began to ridicule me. Only one old man appeared before us. He was intoxicated and refused to accept the Gospel message I shared with him. While the brother with me was discouraging me, my faith in what God had spoken grew even stronger. I refused to be disheartened by his words. With spiritual fervor, I climbed from the dry streambed to the higher ground, gripping the roots as I ascended. There, filled with the Spirit, I began to preach the Word boldly to the only person who had accompanied me. As evening approached, many people started arriving from the small valley, carrying bundles of grass. A crowd gathered, listening intently to the message I was proclaiming. The Holy Spirit worked powerfully, and they confessed their sins, weeping on the ground in repentance. They refused to return home and followed me to the church, where they fasted and prayed for several days. Witnessing this miraculous event in the wilderness, the man who had doubted was filled with joy and glorified God for His mighty work.</p>

The Bhairavapatnam railway gate is quite elevated. As I was crossing the gate, suddenly, a bus appeared in front of me. There was no time to turn my scooter aside. In that instant, the bus came directly toward my scooter. Closing my eyes tightly, I prayed, “Lord, I am returning after dropping off Your servants!” Then, I placed my scooter right between the bus and the gate. After a moment, I opened my eyes. To my amazement, my scooter had moved far ahead from the railway gate and was now on the road. Looking back, I saw that the bus had also passed a great distance away. I praised God and asked, “Lord, how did You save me?”. Then the Lord spoke to me: “I am the One who made a way through the Red Sea. Can I not make a way for you through a bus?”. Hearing this, I was filled with joy. When I shared this experience with the evangelists, they were astonished and praised the Lord.</p>

                  <p>The Lord, in His grace, helped me spend most of my time deeply examining my heart. He revealed even the smallest things to me and taught me to first check if there was any fault within me. I was afflicted with eosinophilia, a condition so severe that it terrified me. I struggled to breathe properly. If cold air touched me, I would start wheezing. Even drinking cold water would make breathing difficult. This suffering was unbearable. I visited many doctors and tried various medicines, but nothing worked. When I took tablets, I would feel a bit drowsy and get temporary relief, but as soon as I woke up, the torment would return. Unable to bear it any longer, I decided to pray about it. I entered the church, leaned against the wall, and sat down. Since I had already taken medicine, I was feeling slightly drowsy. I cried out to God, &quot;Lord, You are here—then what is this?&quot; My eyes closed, and I lost awareness of myself. Then, I had a vision. I saw a large place filled with flowering plants. In the center, there was a majestic royal pathway, leading to the main entrance. Beyond the entrance stood a white building with two stairs. In that beautiful garden, many evangelists were working. As I walked along the royal pathway, some of them saw me and said, &quot;Doctor has called you upstairs.&quot;I immediately went up the stairs. Inside the building, there was a large room. In that room stood a doctor wearing a white robe with a stethoscope around his neck, standing next to a big table. He asked me, &quot;What is your problem?&quot; I replied, &quot;Sir, I am suffering a lot from eosinophilia.&quot;Then, he took a syringe, filled it with medicine, and was about to inject it into my hand. I quickly said, &quot;Sir, injections have caused severe reactions for me before. Please don’t inject it into my hand—give it on my chest instead.&quot;Immediately, he injected me on my chest. I shuddered and let out a gasp, &quot;Ahh!&quot; Even after the vision ended, I could still feel the pain of the injection as if the needle had truly pierced my chest. From that moment on, the disease completely left me, and it never returned. When I went for a blood test, the results showed that eosinophilia was completely normal. Since that day, I have been able to take cold showers, drink cold water, stand in cold air, and even travel in freezing weather—things that were once impossible for me. The  moment I asked, the Lord completely healed me.</p>

                  <p>One night, my wife, children, and I were resting in the church. I was awake, gazing at the glowing light, with tears streaming down my face. In my heart, I thought, “Lord, we are alone in this place.” As I continued looking at the light, I suddenly saw two mighty hands—so large that they covered the entire space of the church. Those hands gently closed over my bed like a shield. I watched everything with my own eyes, yet I felt no fear. Instead, I realized that these were the hands of God. A deep sense of joy and comfort filled my heart. The next morning, my son&#x27;s neck was swollen, and he lay unable to speak. I immediately prayed in the name of Jesus. Instantly, he jumped up and was completely healed!. We praised God with all our hearts!.</p>

                  <p>&quot;I find great joy in practicing faith.&quot; Whenever I asked God for something, He responded immediately. Once, I prayed to the Lord to send a severe drought for ten days. My intention was to personally understand the struggles of the poor. However, the Lord sent a severe drought that lasted six months. This became a severe test of faith for us, especially since we were caring for young children. With nothing to feed them, we resorted to crushing dried jowar meant for chickens, boiling it into gruel, and offering it to the children. But it tasted bitter, and they couldn’t drink it. Left with no other option, we survived by drinking only water. Floods had submerged the fields and reservoirs, leaving even the coconut trees underwater. During this time, I prayed for a man whose kidneys were severely damaged, and God healed him. In gratitude, he harvested coconuts from the flooded trees, sold them, and brought rice for us. By then, it was around eight-thirty or nine at night. Although we now had rice, we had no vegetables or money to buy them. Knowing that the vegetable shops close by seven in the evening, we knelt and prayed, “Lord, you provided the rice; please also provide vegetables.” At nine o&#x27;clock, a vegetable vendor unexpectedly arrived with a bag of vegetables. He said, “I felt led to give these to the church,” placed the bag inside, and left. This unexpected provision was a powerful reminder of God’s faithfulness, strengthening our faith even more.</p>

                  <p>One night, while my wife, children, a young man, and I were praying together, I suddenly felt an excruciating pain in my kidney. My abdomen swelled, and when I tried to urinate, the flow abruptly stopped. It felt as if a knife was piercing through me. The pain was so intense that I couldn’t bear it. A stone had blocked my urinary tract, preventing the flow of urine. I couldn’t walk, and even the slightest movement made the pain unbearable. Those were the early days of my ministry, and we were struggling financially. To seek medical help, I needed to travel nearly 25 kilometers, but the pain was so severe that I doubted I could make it. As I lay there in agony, I questioned myself, wondering if I had done something wrong. Frustration welled up inside me, and I looked up at the sky, crying out, “Lord, if this is happening to me, who will believe in You?”. At that moment, amidst my pain and desperation, I heard a voice—clear and unmistakable. The Lord spoke to me, saying, “Do not be afraid; I am with you.” His words flooded me with comfort and courage. In that very moment, I felt a shift within me. Then, miraculously, the stone, which was slightly longer than an inch, passed out of my body. The pain ceased, and I was overwhelmed with relief and gratitude. The next morning, still amazed by what had happened, I took the stone to a well-known doctor. As he examined it, his face displayed a mixture of disbelief and astonishment. He looked at me and said, “It’s hard to believe this came out on its own. Even the smallest fragment of this stone could have completely blocked the passage, causing severe complications.” He kept staring at the stone, shaking his head in amazement, clearly struggling to accept what he saw. The doctor then sealed the stone in a pack and handed me some medicines. Yet, his skepticism was evident—he simply couldn’t fathom how this was possible. I realized that he couldn’t see the hand of God behind this miracle. So, trusting completely in the Lord who had healed me, I threw the medicines into the field behind the church, never needing them. God, in His mercy and compassion, granted me complete healing. This experience not only strengthened my faith but also became a powerful testimony of His presence and power in my life.</p>

                  <p>Then he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side. Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?"Then he led me back to the bank of the river. As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. And he said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah, and enters the sea; when the water flows into the sea, the water will become fresh. And wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes. Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From Engedi to Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt. And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.” (Ezekiel 47:1-12).</p>

                  <p>The Lord granted me a divine vision aligned with this scripture. I stood upon a platform of bricks, beneath which a tiny stream began to emerge. I observed its rapid surge forward. I ventured into these waters. Initially, they were ankle-deep, but as I continued, they deepened beyond my reach. Mighty waves surged upon its surface. As I swam, I was suddenly lifted by the Spirit, soaring high into the air. From above, I witnessed the waters sprawling across vast distances, transforming into a majestic river. After surveying the expansive lands embraced by this river, I returned to the place from which the waters first emerged. Thus, the Lord imparted a divine promise concerning this ministry. I have cherished the promises bestowed by the Lord deep within my heart.</p>

The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Apostles These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, "Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. Acquire no gold nor silver nor copper for your belts, no bag for your journey, nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff, for the laborer deserves his food” (Matthew 10:1-9)</p>

                  <p>During that time, out of necessity, we constructed a church using Jamail wooden poles, measuring 36 feet in length and 15 feet in width, with a roof covered in bungalow tiles. However, since the structure was built using untreated wooden poles, those embedded in the ground had completely decayed over time. To prevent the church from collapsing, we reinforced it with additional support beams. That night, strong winds began to blow, escalating into a violent storm. Rainwater seeped through the roof, carried by the force of the wind. The church swayed dangerously, creating a perilous situation where there was no possibility of escape. At that time, there were no nearby houses around the church, and even if we cried out for help, no one would be able to hear us. The storm outside was so intense that it was impossible to even stand upright. The children were young and unable to move in such a terrifying situation. The intense fear made our hearts race uncontrollably. I seated my wife and children on the bed, covered them with an umbrella to provide some protection, and attempted to comfort them. However, unable to endure the relentless storm, my wife, the children, three other individuals, and I fervently prayed. With a heavy heart, I cried out, &quot;Lord, send Your angel, for my soul finds no peace.&quot; At that very moment, I witnessed a mighty angel descending from the heavens and positioning himself over the church. He stood firmly on the roof, holding the structure in place. The forceful winds caused his feathers to bend, and his robe fluttered violently. Upon witnessing this divine intervention, I reassured everyone with unwavering confidence: &quot;Not a single tile from the roof will fall, nor will the church collapse. You may all sleep peacefully.&quot; Those who were anxious soon drifted into a deep and peaceful sleep. At dawn, we awoke to a scene of widespread devastation—numerous houses had been reduced to rubble, and massive trees lay fallen across the roads. Yet, the church, which had been on the verge of collapse, remained untouched. The Lord had sent His angel to uphold the church and safeguard our lives. All glory and honor be to God!</p>

                  <p>It was a Wednesday, and the fasting prayer had just concluded. I sat on a cot beside the church. Accompanying me was a sixty-year-old evangelist who was engaged in conversation. Suddenly, we heard the sound of many crying voices coming from behind the church. Curious, the servant asked, “Who is crying over there?” I replied, “The demons are weeping.” Startled, he sprang to his feet, tightening his garment in alarm. With fear and astonishment, he exclaimed, “In all my years, I have never heard of demons weeping!” Trembling, he requested that I escort him to his house.</p>

                  <p>After concluding the gathering at Mondikodu, I reached Mandavalli. It was around one o’clock in the night. As I stepped out of the car, another woman also emerged from the vehicle. I asked her, “Who are you?” She responded, “Sir, they killed me. I came here seeking justice from you.” I firmly replied, “Only God can render justice. Leave now!” Upon hearing this, the spirit vanished.</p>

Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." (Matthew 25:32-40).</p>

                  <p>The Lord has prepared a divine plan for how we should serve Him, ensuring the well-being of many. He reveals to us the way in which we should carry forward this mission. The Lord spoke to me, instructing that alongside preaching the Gospel, our service must also include three key ministries—feeding the hungry, providing clothing, and conducting marriages for those in need. He commanded me to go out into the world and fulfill these responsibilities, ensuring that those in need are cared for. By His grace, we have already been carrying out these ministries with dedication and great effort, striving to act according to His Word. If it is the Lord’s will, we will document the testimonies of those who have been blessed through these services and publish them as a book to glorify God, particularly highlighting how conducting marriages according to His divine plan has brought Him honor. Providing food and clothing may seem relatively simple, but arranging marriages requires great wisdom and careful planning. Despite our sincere efforts, some of those who have benefited from this ministry have revealed their ungrateful and corrupt nature. The Lord has called us to expand these ministries globally, and to accomplish this, financial resources are required. However, until now, neither I nor my fellow servants have sought or accepted any financial assistance from others. Instead, we have labored tirelessly, relying solely on God&#x27;s provision to carry out these works. The Lord Himself will raise up righteous and faithful individuals who will stand as pillars to sustain this mission. Already, many among the fellowship of believers have embraced the heart of Jesus Christ, giving selflessly for the service of the poor, holding back nothing for themselves. The Lord is richly blessing them, both spiritually and in all aspects of their lives. Through this ministry, I have seen God using specific individuals and revealing His divine purposes in remarkable ways.</p>

                  <p>That night, I was sitting with fellow servants on the upper floor of the church, discussing the divine manifestations of God. Until then, the Lord had never spoken to me in English. God can communicate with anyone in any language. Without speaking a word, He can work through His gaze and His Spirit to convict every sin in a person&#x27;s life and lead them into complete salvation. To my astonishment, the Lord spoke in English, saying, Acts Second Second (Acts 2:2). And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.  And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. (Acts 2:2-4). Although I attended college, I never properly learned English. During my years of study, I was living a wayward life, resulting in a lack of focus on my education. After experiencing repentance, I desired to continue my education, but it seemed impossible to set aside time for learning. My days were fully devoted to ministry and strengthening my fellow servants. Nevertheless, both I and those around me desired to learn English.</p>

He said,  Earlier, I heard you say through the microphone that God spoke to you. I have been devout in my worship, visited many sacred places, and even retreated into the wilderness for meditation. Yet, no deity has ever spoken to me. How can you claim that God speaks to you? In response, I told him, God does speak, but you must humble yourself, acknowledge your sins, and pray with a sincere heart. If you do so, the Lord will surely reveal Himself to you. Immediately, he knelt and confessed, I will repent of my sins right now! I desire to hear God’s voice at this very moment. Seeing his urgency, I prayed for him. This young man carried a deep sense of pride based on his background and had previously believed that Jesus Christ was a God of a lesser status. We continued to pray for him, asking the Lord to touch his heart.</p>

                  <p>That night, as he remained in the place of prayer within the church, my family and I were resting in the nearby house. Suddenly, a great light filled the church, radiating so intensely that it extended into our home. My wife was the first to awaken, and she immediately shook me, urging me to look at the light. I opened my eyes, saw the divine radiance, and, recognizing it as God’s presence, closed my eyes again due to their heaviness from sleep. However, my wife insisted, saying, “You must get up! The young man is alone in the church, and the entire place is filled with this heavenly light.” Upon hearing this, I rose quickly and rushed toward the church. As soon as I entered, I saw the young man covering his eyes with his hands, crying out in distress: “Pastor, my eyes are burning! I feel as if I am perishing! I cannot bear this light!” Overcome with conviction, he collapsed to the ground, weeping bitterly. He began to confess, “I am a sinner!” and openly admitted every hidden sin in his life, repenting with a contrite heart. At that moment, the Lord spoke to him.</p>

Whenever they tormented him, God intervened and disciplined them. In His great mercy, the Lord also worked in their hearts, gradually leading them toward transformation. This young man was employed in the police department, and even in his professional life, he remained steadfast in upholding his faith and integrity.</p>

                  <p>The church at Mandavalli had outgrown its premises, prompting the need for expansion. To accommodate this, we decided to purchase the adjacent field located on the eastern side of the church. We approached the elderly woman who owned the land and inquired if she would be willing to sell it to us. However, she became incensed and responded with harsh words before departing. Despite her reaction, the Lord assured us with a promise that she would eventually yield the field. We continued to pray earnestly regarding this matter. The field was fertile and directly bordered the church grounds. Since it was adjacent to the church, the woman often passed through the church premises to access her land. One night, concerned that cattle might enter her field, she walked through the church property. To her astonishment, she saw the Lord Jesus Christ standing beside the church. Unaware of His identity, she asked, “Who is this man?” The Lord did not respond but walked ahead of her toward the field. Clothed in radiant garments, He walked along the ridges of the cultivated land. As He turned and looked at her, a divine presence emanated from Him. Overwhelmed, she dropped the stick she was holding and exclaimed, “Jesus! Is it truly You?” Bowing reverently, she said, “I will surrender this field to You.” At dawn the following day, the elderly woman came to the church and addressed the pastor, saying, “Last night, Jesus walked through my field. He even walked on the ridges of my land. Since He has graced this field with His presence, I am compelled to give it to the church.” We purchased the field from her, paying a price slightly above her initial valuation as a gesture of gratitude. In every circumstance, God orchestrates His divine will in extraordinary ways.</p>

                  <p>A gathering of fellow pastors was taking place. As I was giving them certain warnings, they listened attentively with great focus. Suddenly, a radiant light descended from the heavens onto the place where we were assembled. This light was far brighter than the sun, shining with a pure white brilliance. Our bodies radiated as if illuminated by fluorescent light. The sudden descent of this divine light startled the birds perched in the trees, causing them to fly away. The light remained upon us for a while. After some time, the fellow pastors regained their composure. Filled with joy, they glorified God and walked within the radiance. I remained standing, and in that moment, I could see several villages in the distance. To this day, the fellow pastors who were present continue to testify about this divine light.</p>

                  <p>After completing a worship service in Ingilipakalanka, we were traveling to Mandavalli on our scooters. Raja Rao was riding ahead of me when, suddenly, a speeding vehicle collided with his scooter. With a loud cry, he was thrown off, landing forcefully on the ground. Seeing this, I immediately abandoned my scooter and rushed to hold him. His leg bone was completely dislocated, and right there, in the middle of the road, he breathed his last. I moved his body to the roadside, and the traffic came to a halt. Onlookers were in shock, exclaiming, &quot;How could someone lose their life on such a small road?&quot;Overwhelmed with grief, I wept aloud, crying out, &quot;Lord, we were returning from Your service, yet he has died! How can I continue Your work after this? It would have been better if I had died instead of him.&quot; The weight of sorrow crushed my heart, leaving me utterly broken. My body felt as lifeless as a withered tree, drained of all strength and hope. I was convinced that I was no longer fit to continue serving. At that moment, the Lord spoke to me, saying, &quot;Abraham, what is written upon your hand?&quot;Immediately, I was reminded of the Scripture (Matthew 10), and my heart was stirred to pray. I placed Raja Rao’s head on my lap, rested my hand upon his forehead, and prayed with all my strength for fifteen minutes. Yet, there was no sign of life. I asked the Lord, &quot;Why is there still no response?&quot; The Lord instructed me, &quot;Remove his shirt and place your hand upon his abdomen, then pray again.&quot; Obeying His command, I laid my hand on his stomach and prayed fervently. Suddenly, Raja Rao let out a loud cry and sat up, exclaiming, &quot;Oh no! I feel my life slipping away!&quot; I reassured him, saying, &quot;No, my brother! The Lord has restored your life. Your breath will not depart from you again.&quot;Everyone had seen his leg completely dislocated. I carefully repositioned the bone, and by God&#x27;s miraculous power, it was instantly restored. Thus, Raja Rao was brought back from death to life.Miracles of the Living God</p>

                  <p>As the Gospel meetings were being held, a young boy, who had been leaning against the church wall, suddenly collapsed and passed away. People around him screamed in distress. Realizing that this could disrupt the gathering, I urgently prayed, &quot;Lord, will You not bring him back to life?&quot; As I prayed, the Lord restored life to the child. Many witnessed this miracle and glorified God.</p>

                  <p>During another Gospel gathering in Mandavalli, a massive ten-foot-high wall suddenly collapsed onto a row of chairs. An elderly beggar was seated in one of those chairs. The wall crushed him and shattered five chairs. The entire congregation prayed earnestly for his life. Blood was flowing from his ears, mouth, and wounds. I prayed with unwavering faith, and by God&#x27;s power, he was revived. Through all these experiences, the Lord continued to strengthen, encourage, and use me for His glory.</p>

                  <p>I traveled to the city of Madras for the construction of the L.E.F. church. My days were fully occupied with supervising the construction work, while my evenings were dedicated to evangelistic outreach. Late into the night, I spent hours in prayer. During this period, my wife was pregnant, and I continually prayed for her well-being. After completing my work at the site, I sought a sign from the Lord. I prayed, “Lord, I have been engaged in Your work here. Please watch over my wife and keep her safe. I ask for a sign—let her testify that Your angels stood guard by her side while I was away.” I returned home in May 1986. As soon as my wife saw me, she ran towards me, her face radiant with joy, but her eyes filled with tears. She embraced me tightly and wept aloud. “Why are you crying?” I asked, concerned. She began to recount her experience: “One night, after praying, I fell asleep. At dawn, I suddenly awoke and opened my eyes. To my amazement, I saw two angels standing on either side of my bed. Overwhelmed, I cried out to the Lord, ‘O Lord, did You really send Your angels to guard me?’ I wept and prayed until morning, praising God for His protection.” Hearing her testimony, my heart overflowed with joy and gratitude. I realized that the Lord had granted me the very sign I had asked for. With a heart full of praise, I glorified God for His faithfulness and protection.</p>

                  <p>We resided in a room behind the church. Every night, my wife and I prayed together, often late into the night. One evening, after concluding our prayer, we heard a fervent prayer echoing from within the church. We assumed someone must have entered the sanctuary to pray. Curious, I looked over the church wall, but the moment I peered in, the prayer ceased abruptly. My wife and I were stunned. As I descended, the prayer resumed once more. When I looked over the wall again, the church was empty, and the prayer stopped again. This happened repeatedly, leaving us bewildered and somewhat frightened. We recalled the Scripture and believed, “The Spirit Himself intercedes for us.” Strengthened by this assurance, we continued to listen in awe. One night, at around 1 a.m., Lankapalli Jacob, who lived across the street, heard the prayers coming from the church. Assuming that God’s servants were praying, he decided to join them. Yet, the moment he stepped inside, the prayers stopped. Confused, he returned home, only for the prayers to start once more. After several days of observing this, Jacob approached me and asked, “I keep hearing prayers from the church and come to join, but every time I enter, no one is there. What is happening?” I explained, “It is the Lord Himself interceding on our behalf.” This mysterious prayer continued every night as soon as we finished our own prayers. We grew accustomed to falling asleep to the sound of divine intercession. However, one night, we were restless and could not sleep. We pondered why peace had left us and felt a profound emptiness. We sought the Lord in prayer, asking, “What is missing, Lord?” It was then revealed to us that the divine prayer in the church had ceased. Overwhelmed with grief and repentance, we wept bitterly and pleaded with God for forgiveness. As our hearts were poured out in genuine contrition, the Spirit of the Lord resumed His intercession within the church. From that moment on, we realized that the Lord had placed a hedge of prayer around us, faithfully guarding and guiding us through His divine intercession.</p>

                  <p>As I was reflecting on matters of ministry and praying earnestly, the Lord revealed a vision to me. In the vision, He placed a ring on my finger. This was no ordinary ring; it bore the insignia of India’s national emblem, the three lions. As He did so, He said, “Behold, I grant you authority over India.” From that day onward, the Lord began to use me with divine authority. Moved by this calling, I initiated a prayer warriors’ camp at a central location, dedicated to interceding for India’s salvation and protection. Gradually, we also established sub-centers for prayer camps in other regions. One day, the Lord spoke to me concerning Vijayawada. He revealed, “Many evangelists have fallen because of the darkness over this city. I am giving you authority over the darkness in Vijayawada.” The Lord continued to reveal His will concerning the ministries in Leelanagar and Jangareddygudem, showing me the number of believers who would soon come to faith in those areas. The clarity of these revelations left no room for doubt. One Sunday, as I was preparing for worship, the Lord looked into my eyes and said, “You are feeling slightly unwell, but it will not harm you.” Although His words were comforting, fear gripped me. I immediately prayed, “Lord, if You are aware of my discomfort, please touch me and heal me completely.” During the service, I went up to the dais, knelt down, and looked forward. Suddenly, I saw the Lord walking on the dais toward me. He placed His hand on my head, and in that divine touch, I was instantly healed. Filled with joy and gratitude, I continued to serve the Lord even more zealously. I witnessed His power and authority working through me, fulfilling His great purpose. To God be all the glory.</p>

                  <p>One day, while traveling, I stopped at a fuel station to refuel my car. Just ahead of me, another car had also halted for fuel. The owner of that car, without stepping out, simply handed over the fuel tank keys to the attendant. The attendant filled the tank, locked it, and returned the keys to him. That man was a multimillionaire. Unlike him, I had to step out of my car to open the fuel tank myself. At that moment, a thought crossed my mind—&quot;God can bless me with far greater wealth than this man.&quot; Yet, I immediately dismissed the thought, realizing that I had no desire for such riches. The fuel attendant treated the wealthy man differently because of his riches, allowing him to remain in the car. But I rejoiced, knowing that I possessed something far greater—Jesus Christ. My true wealth is eternal, and no one can take it away from me. That afternoon, as I prayed near a fish pond, a voice from the Lord spoke to me: “Abraham… do you desire crores of rupees, or do you desire lakhs of souls?” Without hesitation, I answered, “Lord, I desire lakhs of souls, not crores of rupees.” My heart overflowed with great joy. Tears streamed down my face—not of sorrow, but of overwhelming gratitude. A deep peace filled my soul. I treasured the words the Lord had spoken to me and glorified Him.</p>

                  <p>Every word that God speaks will surely come to pass. To witness His promises fulfilled, one must wait with patience and perseverance. I have always looked to God, seeking what He desires to teach me. His plans for us are far greater than we can comprehend. Even if there is a delay, the fulfillment of His word will be extraordinary and filled with blessings. God will never abandon us. He will never forsake us.</p>

                  <p>At the beginning of my ministry, I faced numerous challenges. In every situation, I learned to seek God&#x27;s help through prayer. As I climbed higher in my spiritual journey, I encountered unprecedented problems. Yet, I believed that every trial was allowed by God for His glory and purpose. His mysterious words continuously flowed into my heart like a river of life. During my time as a believer, God fulfilled the promise from His Word: “For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with deep compassion, I will bring you back. With everlasting kindness, I will have mercy on you.” In my ministry, He never let go of my hand. God taught me to constantly pray, “Lord, I surrender my soul and body to You.”</p>

                  <p>However, my heart faced deep sorrow due to conflicts in ministry. The differences between my expectations and the actions of fellow believers and ministers troubled me greatly. For several months, I wept in silence before the Lord. Eventually, He revealed the fruit of my tears through a vision. The Vision of the Bridges, I saw a mighty river flowing rapidly from the highlands to the lowlands. Its current was so strong that no human could cross it. There were magnificent bridges built over this river, each with solid foundations. I stood on one of these bridges, along with a few others. As I watched, one bridge after another began to collapse. They rose from their foundations, collided with each other, and shattered into pieces. In the end, all the bridges were destroyed.</p>

                  </div>

                  <p>I stepped off the bridge and walked along the riverbank, weeping. As I moved upstream, a man standing on the bank asked me, “Why are you crying? Go further up along this path.” It was dusk, and I ran with all my strength toward the source of the river. By the time I reached the top, it was dark. There, standing in radiant garments, was a figure who began to speak to me: “A new bridge has been built over this river. It is for you. Cross over it.” I started walking on the new bridge, realizing in my heart, “This bridge is mine. God built it for me. I am responsible for its safety.” The Purpose of the Bridge As I walked, I noticed a crowd following me. But I saw worldliness and a lack of reverence for God in their hearts. I asked, “Who are you? Why are you crossing this bridge?” They replied with the names of their organizations. I was shocked and said, “This bridge was built by Jesus. If your organizations have built other bridges, cross over them.” They began to weep and plead, saying, “Please let us cross over this bridge. There is no other way.” At that moment, my sister-in-law called from the other side of the river, saying, “Brother, the sanctuary is filled with a hundred thousand people waiting to hear the Word. Hurry and come.” She pleaded, “There is no other way. Let them cross as well.” I turned to the crowd and said, “Say, ‘Jesus is our Savior.’” They all confessed, “Jesus is our Savior.” I then crossed over to the sanctuary filled with a hundred thousand people and began to preach the Word. The Promise of Endurance In this vision, the Lord spoke to me, “This bridge will last until the end.” His words filled me with courage and strengthened my resolve to continue His work.</p>

                  <p>I attended gospel meetings and traveled as far as Tadepalligudem. However, I had no money left for the journey back. I stood at the bus stand, uncertain about what to do next. God spoke to me, “Get on the bus; I will provide the money.” Trusting His word, I boarded the bus, wondering how He would fulfill His promise. The conductor gave tickets to everyone and finally reached me. I looked towards God, waiting in faith. Just then, a evangelist from the neighboring bus hurriedly got on my bus, placed some money in my pocket, and quickly got off. The bus started moving. Overwhelmed by this miracle, I praised God for His provision.</p>

                  <p>On another occasion, I traveled to Stuartpuram for gospel meetings with my fellow pastors. I gave them all the money I had, keeping just enough for the return journey, and told them they could use the rest. Unfortunately, they spent all of it, leaving us with no money to get back. At the railway station, they started asking others for help. Someone gave them two rupees, and they came to inform me about it. I couldn’t tolerate it (asahinchukonenu) and asked them to return the money. Then, I began praying. God then told me, “I will provide for you at Tenali railway station.” I shared this with my companions, but they were skeptical. The remaining money was just enough to reach Tenali. As we arrived, they continued to doubt, but I held on to God’s promise. As we walked towards the station in faith, God performed a miracle. My sister, who had come to meet me, was standing there. I called out to her, and she said, “Brother, I came to see you at the meeting.” We went inside the station, sat in a corner, and shared the food she had lovingly prepared. Then, she handed me a large sum of money she had been saving for ministry work. My companions were astonished to see God’s provision just as He had promised.</p>

                  <p>God has never failed to fulfill anything He has spoken to me. He is exalted and glorious, and not a single word of His is ever erased. What God says, He does precisely as promised. If we are His children, then whatever we speak must be aligned with His words. The God who transformed me is powerful enough to transform anyone. There have been countless instances where He provided what I needed without me even asking. These experiences fill my heart with gratitude. I continually praise God.</p>

                  <p>Once, I had to travel to a distant place on my scooter, but there was no petrol at all. I called a young man who was receiving spiritual guidance from me and said, ‘I am going to preach the gospel. Would you like to come with me?’ He was willing to come. I told him, ‘Right now, faith is essential to travel with me. Without faith, you cannot come.’ He replied, ‘I have faith. I can go anywhere with you.’ I then revealed to him that there was no petrol in the scooter and asked him to check the tank. He looked and said sadly, ‘There is not even a drop of petrol left.’ I told him, ‘Now, we are about to witness God’s work. Do you believe?’ He answered, ‘Yes, I believe.’ With that, we both agreed to start the journey and I kick-started the scooter.</p>

                  <p>The scooter went a short distance out of the village and then stopped. The young man expressed some doubt, saying, ‘There is no petrol, so how can this start?’ Because of his doubt, we had to push the scooter for a while. Exhausted from the heat, the young man finally said, ‘Now I have faith. Please start the scooter.’ I tried starting it, and it worked. We continued traveling and reached a village called Kanukollu, where the scooter stopped again in front of my friend&#x27;s convent. My friend came running and asked, ‘Are you alright? Why did you stop here? Do you need any help?’ The young man beside me explained, ‘The scooter stopped because there is no petrol.’ My friend offered to give us petrol and asked us to wait there. I replied, ‘We will take it only if God provides it here; we won’t ask for it.’ I then tilted the scooter and kick-started it again, and it started immediately.</p>

                  <p>We were exhausted and completely out of strength. If the scooter stopped again, we wouldn’t have been able to push it any further. At that moment, God performed a miracle. Two men were traveling on a scooter from a few kilometers away, discussing among themselves, ‘If Abraham Sir asks where we are coming from, what should we say? If he finds out where we went, he won’t approve.’ Just as they feared, they encountered us on the way. When they saw us, they stopped and were visibly shaken. Sensing that they must have done something wrong, I sternly questioned them. Trembling, they approached and confessed, ‘We went to that place,’ and placed some money in my pocket before leaving quickly. We did not ask them for any help, but God provided exactly what we needed for the journey, including money for petrol. With that provision, we were able to fill the scooter with petrol and continue the journey to the distant place for ministry. Trusting in God made our mission successful. In this way, God helped both of us to grow in faith and continue in His grace.</p>

                  <p>As the old church was insufficient, we started the construction of a new church. With only faith, we began this great task. Every material required for the church had to be received by asking the Lord. Sand, chips, cement, iron, bricks – I informed God of these needs through prayer. God provided whatever was needed for the work at the right time. Even regarding paying wages to the workers, until they finished their work and stood before me, I looked to God alone. When they asked for their wages, God miraculously provided. I was amazed at God&#x27;s great mercy. The construction of the church progressed wonderfully to a certain extent. That night, my wife and I fasted and prayed. Angels of God were bending the rods for the centering of the columns. Seeing this vision, I praised the Lord. After a few days, the work reached the slab stage. In even greater numbers than before, God&#x27;s angels descended and bent the rods for the slab as well. In the morning, I told my wife that God&#x27;s angels had done the rod binding for the church slab. Later, God performed another miracle. I had put fish in a pond – about eighteen thousand in number. A month and fifteen days had passed by then. A person leased the pond along with the fish. He gave me one lakh ninety thousand rupees, and another person added ten thousand rupees, making a total of two lakh rupees. At that time, some material was already available. With the remaining material and these two lakh rupees, the slab for the church was completed. In this way, God accomplished His work. The church dedication was conducted magnificently. During the construction, God sent His angels to complete the work. Praise be to God.</p>

                  <p>It began small, but just as the Lord had said, revival ignited in each person. Through these flames of revival, the sinful states in many lives were burned away, transforming them into people with new lives. Thieves returned what they had stolen. Adulterers confessed their sinful states and made amends with those they had wronged. Corrupt officials and minor employees felt remorse for their bribes and agreed to return the money. Murderers surrendered their lives fully to God. Hypocritical servants and believers confessed their secret sins and repented. Separated families, after confessing their hidden sins, were reunited by the Lord&#x27;s help. Parents who were grieving over their runaway children confessed their sins and prayed, leading the Lord to bring their children back to them. Those suffering from AIDS confessed and turned away from their sins. They received the power of the Living God and continued their work happily and healthily, supporting their families. The weak were made to run, and those declared terminally ill by doctors were restored to health by the Lord. The Scripture that says, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom His favor rests,” was being fulfilled before our very ears.</p>

                  <p>Brother Rajarao and his wife, Kumari, exemplified transformed lives that became a blessing to the West Godavari District. They dedicated their lives entirely to God. In the early days of my ministry, many who experienced transformation through our service devoted themselves to God as ministers. I rejoice greatly in giving testimony about these spiritual children. I praise God because they walk in the same path of faith and obedience that I strive to follow in Christ. Thousands of people flocked to the revival meetings in Akiveedu, drawn by the power of the Gospel proclaimed through our ministry. Just as I labored to restore and strengthen families, these devoted couples, with sacrificial hearts, embraced many like spiritual parents. Despite losing their biological children, God blessed them with an even greater family—spiritual parents, brothers, sisters, children, and countless beloved ones in faith. They received a ministry so profound that even angels would marvel. God continues to use them mightily alongside me in Krishna, Guntur, and Godavari districts, impacting numerous lives for His glory.</p>

                  <p>It is a great privilege to witness Salmon’s repentance and transformation from a fishing tribe ,an idol-worshipping background was truly remarkable. His parents and he himself were idol worshippers. When he came to the capital, he and his wife had separated. However, when the light of the Gospel touched him, his heart changed. He reconciled with his wife and brought her back home. Later, his wife also came to faith, and together they served in ministry for some time.Following God&#x27;s call, they settled in Matlam, Pedalanka, Matlam ,Lakshmipuram, and other villages, ministering along the coastal areas. After completing the construction of churches ,They were serving God with all their strength. Many people experienced a transformation through his work.Even among traditional believers, children of God&#x27;s servants repented, confessing not only their own faults but also the faults of their parents. The Lord showed His patience toward those who were stubborn, drawing them into His grace. In this way, church evangelist traveled across the coastal villages, spreading the joy of salvation.However, not everyone welcomed these transformations. Some people could not bear to see others change and turn to God. Because of this, the brother faced many obstacles. Yet, with unwavering faith, he ran the race set before him, keeping his eyes on Jesus, the author and sustainer of faith. His dedication gives hope that the Lord will raise up millions of transformed lives through his work.He did not hold onto anything as his own but surrendered everything to God. The Lord strengthened him, allowing him to serve with all his might. His parents also supported his mission wholeheartedly.Many fishermen who cast their nets into the sea experienced a repentance. They witnessed miracles and became devoted evangelists. Among them, many sacrificers arose, willing to give up everything for the Lord.Even in poverty, without knowing where their next meal would come from, their faith remained steadfast. Seeing their sacrifices and commitment to helping others, I praised greatly to God. Their selfless love mirrored the very heart of Christ. The compassion of these poor yet faithful believers compelled them to seek miracles beyond imagination. God, in His mercy, performed extraordinary miracles among them, knowing that without signs and wonders, their faith might weaken. Therefore, God&#x27;s grace was abundantly poured out upon them, sustaining them in their walk with Him.</p>
